","<h1>1.G 3-D Shape Sort</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a whole group, students will sort a collection of three-dimensional objects into categories by shape. There should be several that fall into each of the categories below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>sphere</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cone</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>pyramid</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cube</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cylinder</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>rectangular prism</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As a class, students brainstorm attributes of the objects they have classified, and the teacher writes those attributes where the entire class can see them. Students then use one of the following sentence frames as they classify the objects. The sentence frames should be written on sentence strips or some other large paper so that the entire class can read/see them during the activity.)</p>

<p>The ___________ is in the shape of a __________ . It is/has __________ , just like all ____________.</p>

<p>The ___________ is in the shape of a __________ . It is/has ___________ , but some ___________ aren&#39;t/don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The teacher models with one or two objects to start. An example would be:</p>

<p>&quot;The can is in the shape of a cylinder. It has circles on the ends, just like all cylinders.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The can is a in the shape of a cylinder. It is made of metal, but some cylinders aren&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>This will help students distinguish between defining attributes and non-defining attributes.</p>

<p>Once students are familiar with this task they can be given a set of cards and can work in pairs to classify by defining attribute using the (now familiar) sentence frames.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attributes that students describe will vary, but here are some examples (in adult language):</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The baseball is in the shape of a sphere. It is round, just like all spheres.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The orange is in the shape of a sphere. It is orange, but some spheres aren&#39;t.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The food can is in the shape of a cylinder. The label is a rectangle when we take it off and lay it flat, just like all cylinders (if we could remove the surface).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The toilet paper roll is in the shape of a cylinder. It is made of paper, but some cylinders aren&#39;t.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The box of markers is in the shape of a rectangular prism. The corners are square, just like all rectangular prisms.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The brick is in the shape of a rectangular prism. It is heavy, but some rectangular prisms aren&#39;t.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Egyptian pyramids are in the shape of a pyramid. They come to a point at the top, just like all pyramids.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The food pyramid is not in the shape of a pyramid. It is flat, which is why it isn&#39;t a real pyramid.</p>
	</li>

<p>[Students] differentiate between geometrically defining attributes (e.g., &ldquo;hexagons have six straight sides&rdquo;) and nondefining attributes (e.g., color, overall size, or orientation).For example, they might say of this shape, &ldquo;This has to go with the squares, because all four sides are the same, and these are square corners. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which way it&rsquo;s turned&rdquo; (MP3, MP7). They explain why the variants shown earlier (p. 6) are members of familiar shape categories and why the difficult distractors are not, and they draw examples and nonexamples of the shape categories (MP7, MP8).</p>

Then they write their partner&rsquo;s name in the speech bubble where it says &ldquo;I am_______&rdquo;. Student A measures Student B using the unifix cubes and records the length of Student B&rsquo;s arm, leg, foot, hand and neck in the corresponding boxes. Students should connect the unifix cubes to make a measuring stick from them as opposed to lining individual cubes up next to their partner. Once Student A finishes, the partners switch and, using a second worksheet (or the reverse side if the teacher copies the worksheets so that they are double sided), Student B now measures Student A and records the values. Once they are finished, the students return to the whole group where the teacher can ask,</p>

<blockquote>Who has the longest leg, you or your partner?</blockquote>

<p>The students should then stand side-by-side to verify that their measurements correctly identified the longest leg. If they don&#39;t, then students should re-measure their legs. It is easy for students to lose track while counting or to measure imprecisely. This would be a good opportunity for teachers to talk about how it is important to measure carefully in order to get accurate measurements. Students who finish early can measure other objects in the classroom.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Correct if student writes the number 82.</p>

<p>The best way to find the sum is to take advantage of place value, adding ones to ones and tens to tens.</p>

<p>There are several ways this can be done. Some first graders might use the standard algorithm to organize their work:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://achievethecore.org/content/upload/1.NBT.C.4%20Image2.PNG"" style=""height:171px; width:199px"" /></p>

<p>Many students will first combine the tens (50 + 20 = 70), next combine the ones (6 + 6 = 12), and finally add these results to obtain the final answer: 70 + 12 = 82. This approach is fine in grade 1. As problems get more complicated, students will learn increasingly efficient procedures culminating in the standard algorithms.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://achievethecore.org/content/upload/1.NBT.C.4%20Image3.PNG"" style=""float:right; height:315px; width:326px"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some students may draw pictures of tens and ones to help them find the sum. In the diagram to the right, a long line represents a ten and a dot represents a one. The top part of the picture shows 56, and the part beneath that shows 26. Effectively, the diagram explains why the numerical procedures give the right answer. Students should be able to show what is going on; diagrams like these will be useful in second grade when students learn to add and subtract three-digit numbers. However, in second grade students will be expected to find sums like 56 + 26 fluently, working with the number symbols themselves rather than using diagrams or objects for support.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, some students might try using mental arithmetic. For example, they could use a compensation approach: consider that if we were to increase 26 by four, and decrease 56 by four, then we would have an equivalent but easier problem: 52 + 30 = 82. This approach shows good number sense&mdash;it is the kind of thinking that will be valuable later on in algebra. However, compensation and other opportunistic approaches don&rsquo;t generalize well to calculations like 8753 &ndash; 2476, which is why students need to learn systematic methods based on place value. And for most first graders, trying to add 56 + 26 mentally will likely result in a wrong answer because of a mistake along the way.</p>

		<li>One half of the circle is shaded because the shaded region and the unshaded region have the same shape and size, making each one half of the full circle. This is perhaps the picture most frequently associated with the words &quot;half of a circle&quot; or &quot;semi-circle.&quot;</li>
		<li>Less than one half of this circle is shaded. Visually, the shaded area is far less then the unshaded area while the two would be equal if the shaded area represented one half of the circle. Mathematically, the shaded area represents one third of the circle since one of three equal pieces is shaded. One way to see this is to note that if a cookie is divided into 3 equal shares, each share is less than if the same cookie is divided into two equal shares.</li>
		<li>One half of this rectangle is shaded. This can be seen geometrically as the shape and size of the black triangle is identical to the shape and size of the white triangle, making each one half of the whole rectangle. Concretely, if the rectangle is cut in half and then the white triangle is rotated by $180$ degrees about the center of the rectangle, then it will lie precisely on top of the black triangle.</li>
		<li>More than one half of this rectangle is shaded. Visually the black shaded piece is far larger than the white unshaded piece and so this picture does not show one half.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In picture (ii), the shaded area is equal to each of the two unshaded pieces and so the unshaded area is larger than the shaded area (twice as large). So the shaded area represents less than one half.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In picture (iv), the shaded part of the rectangle is larger than the unshaded part and so the shaded area is more than one half of the area of the rectangle. Unlike picture (ii) which represents one third, however, the lower picture does not provide enough information to conclude precisely what fraction of the rectangle is shaded.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hand span is a measure of distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger with the hand fully extended.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each student places his or her dominant hand on the edge of a piece of paper with the hand fully extended.</li>
	<li>The student should make a mark at the tip of the thumb and the tip of the little finger. The distance between marks is the length of the hand span.</li>
	<li>The student should measure his or her hand span with a centimeter ruler and round the measurement to the nearest whole centimeter.</li>
	<li>Each student should record his or her measurement on a piece of paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>The teacher can ask each student for his or her measurement and record the data using a line plot with a horizontal scale marked off in whole centimeters. Alternatively, the teacher can set up the line plot and ask each student to come record his or her own hand span, showing the students how by recording the teacher&#39;s hand span.</p>

<p>Students should comment about patterns they observe the line plot and write or discuss the answers to these two questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>What are the largest and smallest spans? What is the difference between the largest and smallest spans?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use words to describe the shape of the data set. Does it appear taller in the center like a mountain? Are there peaks in more than one place? Is the shape of the data flat like a table top? Are there gaps? Are some hand spans much bigger or smaller than the others?</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students from ages 6 &ndash; 12 usually have a span in the range of 15 to 20 cm, with an average of about 17 cm. The teacher or students should record class data by placing an X above the appropriate number on the horizontal scale for each hand span that is measured. Or, provide a square post-it note to each student. Each student records his or her hand span on the note and posts it directly above the appropriate number on the horizontal line plot. The scale on the graph should match the size of the post-it notes. Post-it notes should be placed edge-to-edge and should not overlap.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>140, 140.</p>

	<p>The first problem asks for the same number (140) in different ways. This emphasizes that order doesn&rsquo;t matter in addition &ndash; yet order is everything when using place-value notation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>14 tens = 10 tens + 4 tens</p>

	<p>14 tens = 1 hundred+4 tens</p>

	<p>14 tens = 140.</p>

	<p>In this problem, the base‐ten units in 140 are bundled in different ways. In the first line, &ldquo;tens&rdquo; are thought of as units: 14 things = 10 things + 4 things.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>507.</p>

	<p>By scrambling the usual order, the third problem requires students to link the values of the parts with the order of the digits in the positional system. Also, to encode the quantity, the student will have to think: &ldquo;no tens,&rdquo; emphasizing the role of 0.</p>

	<p>7 ones + 5 hundreds = 507</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>800.</p>

	<p>In the fourth problem, the zeros come with a silent &ldquo;no tens and no ones&rdquo;:</p>

	<p>8 hundreds = 800</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>106 = 1 hundred + 0 tens + 6 ones</p>

	<p>106 = 10 tens + 6 ones</p>

	<p>106 = 106 ones</p>

	<p>In this problem, the base-ten units in 106 are bundled in different ways. This is helpful when learning how to subtract in a problem like 106 &ndash; 34 by thinking about 106 as 100 tens and 6 ones.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>394.</p>

	<p>The sixth problem is meant to illustrate the notion that If the order is always given &ldquo;correctly,&rdquo; then all we do is teach students rote strategies without thinking about the size of the units or how to encode them in positional notation.</p>

	<p>90 + 300 + 4 = 394</p>

The reason it took one less week than if we had added up the number of weeks we found above is that the extra money earned in the 4th week above and beyond what he needed for his sister&#39;s present combined with the extra money saved in the 11th week equals one week&#39;s allowance.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>$657 = 457+100+100$. Many approaches are possible for comparing the numbers on each side, such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Both sides have a 57 and some hundreds. On the left there are 6 hundreds, and on the right there are 4 hundreds plus 2 more. So there are 6 hundreds on each side, and the two sides are equal.</li>
		<li>Students could notice that the tens and ones digits of the numbers on either side will be equal, and then skip-count by 100s:
		<blockquote>Four hundred fifty-seven, five hundred fifty-seven, six hundred fifty-seven.... So the numbers on both sides are equal: 657 = 457+100+100.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>This process could also be visualized on a number line, which shows the size of the terms being added: <img alt=""Solution_1_712c1d6bbe37b8478c375d2be042c29b"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/494/medium/Solution_1_712c1d6bbe37b8478c375d2be042c29b.jpg?1372189951"" /></li>
		<li>Of course students could also add the numbers 457, 100, and 100 vertically. That doesn&rsquo;t stress thinking about the sizes of the base-ten units, however. So suppose we merely visualize doing this, rather than going to the trouble to write it down&mdash;then because of all the zeros, we can see that the tens digit of the sum will be 5 and the ones digit will be 7, while the hundreds digit will be 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. (From this one can see the relationship between the meanings of the digits, place value notation, and the vertical method.)</li>
		<li>
		<p>$926 \gt 726+100+10$. Some possible approaches:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>On the left there are 9 hundreds, and on the right there are 7 hundreds plus 1 more hundred. So there are 9 hundreds on the left and 8 hundreds on the right. On the right there are 26+10 ones as well, which is still less than 100, so the left is greater than the right hand side.</li>
			<li>If the right-hand side were 726 + 100 + 100, then it would be like part (a): &quot;726, 826, 926.&quot; But we won&rsquo;t get to 926 because the last term added is much smaller than 100. So 926 $\gt$ 726 + 100 + 10.</li>

		<p>$511 + 10 + 10 + 10 \gt 531 - 10 - 10$. Some possible approaches:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>There are 5 hundreds on each side and 1 one on each side. There are 4 tens on the left and 3 minus 2 tens on the right. So the left is greater than the right hand side.</p>

2.NBT.B.5,"<p>Fluently add and subtract within 100 using strategies based on place value, <a id=""[3]"" name=""[3]"">properties of operations</a>, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.</p>
","<p>This example task comes from a video from Global Education Resources, which can be found <a href=""http://www.globaledresources.com/resources/curious-subtraction.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The joint purpose of this task is to provide students an opportunity to practice two-digit subtraction with regrouping and to engage students in looking for and expressing regularity in repeated reasoning (MP.8).&nbsp;Throughout grade 2, students need many opportunities to practice subtraction in order to achieve fluency subtracting within 100 by the end of the grade. For students in grade 2, it is sufficient for them to recognize that differences of 9 will stem from numbers whose digits differ by 1, subtractions resulting in 18 will stem from numbers whose digits differ by 2, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Task: Actions</strong></p>

<p>The teacher sets the stage by letting students know that today they will investigate an interesting thing that happens when subtracting certain numbers. (<em>For an illustration of this, please see video, start-1:17</em>)</p>

<p>The investigation begins with the teacher displaying the digits 1 through 9 on the board. S/he chooses two digits and asks the class what possible two-digit numbers they can make. (<em>For an illustration of this, please see video, 1:17-2:16</em>)</p>

<p>The teacher then asks students to find the difference between the numbers they created. (The problem and the difference should be recorded on the subtraction template.) The teacher leads students through a second example, making sure to choose digits that will have the same result as the first example. (<em>For an illustration of this, please see video, 2:16-5:10</em>)</p>

<p>The teacher then asks the students if the result will always be the same when subtracting two two-digit numbers made from the same pair of digits and challenges them to find out. Students can work independently or with partners using the subtraction template. As the students work, the teacher has the opportunity to encourage students to try different digit combinations and support any students who are subtracting incorrectly. After enough time has passed, the teacher has the students put their results (subtraction templates or equations) on the board. (<em>For an illustration of this, please see video, 5:10-6:55</em>)</p>

<p>Once the results are all on the board, the class discussion begins. (<em>For an illustration of this, please see video, 6:55-13:56</em>) Follow up questions the teacher may ask include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Were all of our answers the same?</li>
	<li>What are all the differences that our class found?</li>
	<li>Do you think we missed any possible differences?</li>
	<li>Is there anything special about the differences we found?</li>
	<li>With your partner, discuss one or two interesting things you wrote down about the results of this investigation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Task: Solution</strong></p>

<p>Having worked extensively with place value in grade 1 (1.NBT.B), students should come to grade 2 able to make both possible two-digit numbers from any given two digits.</p>

<p>The answers for the subtraction problems are dependent upon the numbers chosen, but are always multiples of 9 (e.g., if the digits 5 and 9 are selected, the numbers 59 and 95 are possible. When subtracting 59 from 95, the result is 36, a multiple of 9.).</p>

<p>The students should notice that when their subtraction result is 9, the difference of the two digits used is 1 (the numbers are consecutive or adjacent). When the result is 18, the difference is 2 (the numbers are &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo;). And so on. Some students may also notice that the digits in the results have a sum of nine if they are added together.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 3 </span></p>

<p>Using base-ten blocks:</p>

<p>Start with 1 hundred, 8 tens, 0 ones. We can&rsquo;t take away 4 ones from 0 ones so we have to break a ten into 10 ones. I now have 7 tens 10 ones. Now we can subtract using the take-away model.</p>

<p>10 - 4 = 6.</p>

<p>70 - 20 = 50.</p>

<p>100 - 100 = 0.</p>

<p>So there are 56 days of school before we get out for summer vacation. Here is a picturing showing the 100s, 10s and 1s.</p>

<p><img alt=""3_a18b0e146ed16c0525c4fb4db7ed3c46"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/591/large/3_a18b0e146ed16c0525c4fb4db7ed3c46.jpg?1350066102"" /></p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 </span></p>

<p>Count by ones to the next decade: 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130. So we have added 6.</p>

<p>Then count by tens: 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, which makes 5 tens or 50.</p>

<p>Since 50 + 6 = 56, there are 56 days left before we get out of school for summer vacation.</p>

<p>Students can use the 100s board or draw an &quot;empty number line&quot; to help them count.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 </span></p>

<p>Count by tens from 124: 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184. That is 6 tens or 60.</p>

<p>But 184 is too big so count back to 180, which is 4.</p>

<p>Subtract 4 from 60 to get 56. We have 56 days of school left.</p>

The teacher will then ask how students can show the number that is 10 more and invite another student volunteer to build 10 more with cubes.&nbsp; Student may add 10 individual units or a ten stick. The goal is for students to move from counting ten units to counting one unit of 10, and to connect the concrete representations of the numbers with abstract oral counting. The teacher will then record 13 on the chart and continue this process, asking students &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 10 more than __?&rdquo; and have student volunteers show 10 more with the base-ten blocks. At some point, a student will likely use a ten stick instead of ten ones; when this happens, the teacher can help the students see this is a more efficient strategy.

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout the task, students will identify the number that is 10 more in the counting sequence.&nbsp; Through teacher questioning, some ideas that may emerge from the experience include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>All of the numbers end in the three.</li>
	<li>If we don&rsquo;t look at the 3 in each number, the numbers are counting, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</li>
	<li>Numbers in the ones place are not changing.</li>
	<li>Numbers in the tens place are changing and growing by 1.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>When looking at the columns, the numbers grow by 100.</li>
	<li>When looking at the columns, the digits in the ones and tens places do not change but the digits in the hundreds place increase by 1.</li>
	<li>The numbers grow by 100 when looking down because there are 10 numbers in each row and 10 groups of 10 is 100.</li>
	<li>213 will come next because it is 10 more than 203 and 113 is above it.</li>
	<li>The next row will begin with 303 because that is 100 more than 203.</li>
	<li>393 will be at the end of the fourth row because if each row is 100 more, 193+100=293, 293+100=393.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Closing:</p>

<p>38+10=48</p>

<p>124+10=134&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can use what I know about counting to find 10 more than any number.&nbsp; I can start at the given number and count by tens.&nbsp; I also noticed that when adding 10 more, the only number that changed is the number in the tens place so I know that 10 more than 124 is 134.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Begin by playing the game as a whole class to demonstrate the rules and for students to illustrate the range of possible strategies.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Have a student pick 5 number cards from the cards labeled 1 through 10. Then, have another student pick a &ldquo;Target Number&rdquo; between 10 through 20. Students must add and/or subtract 2 or more of the 5 number cards to arrive at the &ldquo;target&rdquo; number.</p>

	<li>
	<p>As students present the different number combinations for the &ldquo;target&rdquo; number, write their expressions on the board and have them explain how they were able to mentally come up with the solution.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>As students explain their reasoning, name the strategies they used. For example, look for students making fives (e.g. 6 + 8 = 5 + 1 + 5 +3= 10 + 4 = 14) and tens (9 + 8 = 10 + 7), and using known facts (e.g. 8 + 8 is 16 so 8 + 7 is one less than 16) to encourage flexible thinking about the relationship among the facts.</p>

	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This solution uses the language of even and odd even though the task statement does not. For students who are already familiar with that terminology, it would be great if they recognize that it is appropriate here and use it. For students who are not familiar with it, this task provides a great opportunity for teachers to introduce it.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The first arrangement can be divided into two equal parts; for example, we can divide the pattern into the top half and the bottom half. This means that the number of tiles in this arrangement is even.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If we try pairing tiles in the second seating arrangement, we end up with one tile left over. Therefore, the number of tiles in this arrangement is odd.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The tiles in this arrangement are in a 4-by-4 array, so the total number of tiles is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16. Again, we can divide this arrangement into a top half and a bottom half, so the number of tiles is even.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When the number of tiles is even, Leslie can divide the tiles into two equal-sized groups, one to be made of red tiles and one to be made of blue tiles. She can then create the pattern using an equal number of tiles of each color. When the number of tiles is odd, there will have to be a color (red or blue) that has at least one more tile than the other color. Therefore, Leslie should use a pattern with an even number of tiles if she wants to use the same number of red and blue tiles.</p>

<p>b. If I imagine moving the two unshaded pieces together, I can see that they don&#39;t fill up half the circle. So more than half must be shaded.</p>

<p>c. The circle is in 4 equal parts and 2 are shaded. So half the circle is shaded.</p>

<p>d. The small shaded piece on the left is the same size as the unshaded piece on the right. I imagined that those two pieces traded places, so that I could see that half the circle is shaded.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>This picture represents one half. The shaded area is equal in size and shape to the unshaded area: this can be shown by rotating the picture, about the center of the circle, by $180$ degrees so that the black and white parts trade places. Alternatively, if the shape is cut, the white part is the same shape and size as the black part.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This picture does not represent one half. The shaded part is visually larger than the unshaded part. Cutting out the unshaded pieces will show that the unshaded part is in fact equal to one of the two equal shaded pieces so that the shaded part actually represents two thirds of the circle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This picture represents $\frac{2}{4}$ as there are four equally sized pieces and two of them are shaded. Since $\frac{2}{4}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{2}$ the shaded portion of this picture does represent one half. Another way to see this would be to cut out the two shaded and unshaded pieces and observe that each shaded piece is identical in shape and size to an unshaded piece making the shaded and unshaded areas equal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This picture is a creative and interesting way to represent one half of a circle. To see that the shaded part represents one half of the circle, notice that this picture becomes identical to picture (c) if the lower right shaded slice of the circle is moved over next to the lower left shaded slice. Alternatively, the picture can be rotated counterclockwise by $90$ degrees and the shaded and unshaded parts trade places and so they must be equal. Thirdly, we can observe that each shaded piece may be paired up with an unshaded piece of equal size so again the shaded and unshaded areas must be equal, meaning that the shaded area represents one half of the whole circle.</p>

Rounding to the unit represented by the leftmost place is typically the sort of estimate that is easiest for students and often is sufficient for practical purposes.

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Each student has a box of 10 pencils, which is one group of 10. There are 4 students at each table, so there are 4 groups of 10 pencils or $4\times 10$ pencils at each table. We also know that the &quot;4&quot; in the number 40 means &quot;4 tens&quot; so we know there are 40 pencils at each table.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>First, there are $4\times 10$ pencils at each table. Since there are 6 tables, and 40 pencils at each table, there are $6\times 40$ pencils in total. This 40 arose as 4 groups of 10, or, $4\times 10$, so there are $$6\times (4\times 10)$$ pencils in total. By the associative property of multiplication, this is also $(6\times 4)\times 10 = 24\times 10$ pencils. 24 tens is 240, so there are 240 pencils in total.</p>

At Felix&#39; school, there are 6 class periods of the same length each day. Alec&#39;s day is broken into 3 class periods of equal length. One day, it snowed a lot so both of their schools started late. Felix only had four classes and Alec only had two.

Previously, in Grade 2, students compared lengths using a standard measurement unit. In Grade 3, they build on this idea to compare fractions with the same denominator. They see that for fractions that have the same denominator, the underlying unit fractions are the same size, so the fraction with the greater numerator is greater because it is made of more unit fractions. For example, [a] segment from 0 to 3/4 is shorter than the segment from 0 to 5/4 because it measures 3 units of 1/4 as opposed to 5 units of 1/4. Therefore 3/4 &lt; 5/4.</p>

","<h1>Plums</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Four situations are described below. In one situation, the number of plums is equal to 8 &times; 4. Which situation is it?</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A.&nbsp;Hershel has 8 plums and gives 4 plums to each friend.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B.&nbsp;Jazmine makes 8 goodie bags with 4 plums in each bag.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C.&nbsp;Lawrence has 8 plums and Kaliyah has 4 more plums than Lawrence.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D.&nbsp;Sabrina has 8 ripe plums and 4 unripe plums.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Correct if student selects B: Jazmine makes 8 goodie bags with 4 plums in each bag.</p>

<p>The product 8 &times; 4 means the number of things in 8 groups of 4 things each, or the number of things in 4 groups of 8 things each. In situation B, there are 8 groups of plums with 4 plums in each group. So the number of plums in situation B is 8 &times; 4. The correct answer is B.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to calculate the value of the product 8 &times; 4 to answer the question. (The question is not about what 8 &times; 4 equals&mdash;the question is about what 8 &times; 4 means.)</p>

<p>In none of the other situations is the number of plums 8 &times; 4:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In situation A, there are 8 plums. (Situation A could be thought of as a division situation because there are 8 &divide; 4 = 2 friends.)</li>
	<li>In situation C, there are 8 + (8 + 4) plums.</li>
	<li>In situation D, there are 8 + 4 plums.</li>
</ul>

<p>If students have trouble answering this question, you might ask them to draw a diagram of each situation. Drawing the diagrams might help to clarify which operations are relevant to each situation.</p>

Additional information from the Commentary: Students will likely know these facts relatively quickly and come to the conclusion that both sides are equal to 40, thus this equation is true. When pressed to see other options, students may reason that the 8 can be broken down into 4 x 2. The equation becomes 5 x (2 x 4) = 10 x 4. Through the associative property, this becomes (5 x 2) x 4 = 10 x 4. We can see that these expressions are equivalent because we know that 5 x 2 has the same value as 10.</li>

	<li>8 x 6 = 7 x 6 + 6 This is true. Both sides have a value of 48. Additional information from the Commentary: third graders understand multiplication in terms of equal groups. Students might reason that 8 x 6 means 8 groups of 6. Thus 7 x 6 + 6 would mean 7 groups of 6 with another group of 6. Students might recognize that extra 6 as the &quot;8th group of 6&quot; thereby making the two expressions equivalent.</li>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Decide if the equations are true or false. Explain your answer.</p>

<ol>
	<li>4 x 5 = 20 This is true. Both sides have a value of 20.</li>
	<li>34 = 7 x 5 This is not true. The value of 7 x 5 is 35. Students may also recognize that all multiples of 5 end in 0 or 5 and conclude that this equation is not true without evaluating 7 x 5.</li>
	<li>3 x 6 = 9 x 2 This is true. Both sides have a value of 18.</li>
	<li>5 x 8 = 10 x 4 This is true. Both sides have a value of 40. Additional information from the Commentary: Students will likely know these facts relatively quickly and come to the conclusion that both sides are equal to 40, thus this equation is true. When pressed to see other options, students may reason that the 8 can be broken down into 4 x 2. The equation becomes 5 x (2 x 4) = 10 x 4. Through the associative property, this becomes (5 x 2) x 4 = 10 x 4. We can see that these expressions are equivalent because we know that 5 x 2 has the same value as 10.</li>
	<li>6 x 9 = 5 x 10 This is not true. The value of 6 x 9 is 54 and the value of 5 x 10 is 50. This is included to see if students mistakenly try to use compensation strategies from addition.</li>
	<li>2 x (3 x 4) = 8 x 3 This is true. Both sides have a value of 24. See the commentary for further suggestions on what ideas to elicit from students.</li>
	<li>8 x 6 = 7 x 6 + 6 This is true. Both sides have a value of 48. Additional information from the Commentary: third graders understand multiplication in terms of equal groups. Students might reason that 8 x 6 means 8 groups of 6. Thus 7 x 6 + 6 would mean 7 groups of 6 with another group of 6. Students might recognize that extra 6 as the &quot;8th group of 6&quot; thereby making the two expressions equivalent.</li>
	<li>4 x (10 + 2) = 40 + 2 This is not true. 4 x (10 + 2) has a value of 48, and 40 + 2 has a value of 42. This equation presents an opportunity for students to reason using the distributive property.</li>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The first equation comes from writing 5 as 2+3. The reason for this is that in the next step we will group the 2 together with the 8 to make a 10. This second step uses the associative property of addition. In the third step, we add 10 + 3 to find the answer of 13.</p>

	<p>In terms of the addition table, we can visualize adding 5 to 8 by starting at the 8 in the column of addends and moving over 5 spaces to the right. Notice that after two steps, we reach 10. Then three more steps puts us at 13. This is shown in the picture below:</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This method is similar to the making a ten method in part (b). In this case, however, a ten is made by rewriting 9 as 10 - 1. Then the 3 and 10 are grouped together first before performing the subtraction in the final step. This is shown in the picture below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The letter A is composed of 3 line segments which meet in three places and form 5 angles less than 180 degrees. Three of these angles are acute, and two are obtuse. Note that students might also count angles that are greater than 180 degrees, so it is important for students to explicitly identify the angles they see. For example, a student might see an angle greater than 180 degrees at the top of the letter A.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, the a student might see the letter A as being composed of 5 line segments and see two straight-angles on the sides of the letter A where the horizontal segment meets them. Of course, this isn&#39;t the smallest number of pieces needed to build the letter A, but it is a correct decomposition and analysis of it.</p>

	<p>None of the line segments are perpendicular or parallel.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The hardest ones are the ones composed of both segments and curves. B can be made from 4 segments and two semi-circles, for example:</p>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To compare the measurements we convert them to inches. For this we need to know that there are 12 inches in a foot and 3 feet in a yard. So there are $3 \times 12 = 36$ inches in a yard.</p>

<p>Sarah&#39;s height is already in inches. Jake&#39;s height is 4$\frac{1}{4}$ feet. This is the same as 4+$\frac{1}{4}$ feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there are $4 \times 12 = 48$ inches in 4 feet, and $3$ inches in a a $\frac14$ foot. So Jake&#39;s height in inches is $48 + 3 = 51$ inches.</p>

<p>For Andy we have seen that there are 36 inches in a yard, so there are 18 inches in half a yard, so in inches Andy&#39;s height is $36 + 18 = 54$.</p>

<p>Finally Emily is 4 feet and 4 inches tall. There are $4 \times 12 = 48$ inches in 4 feet, so Emily is $48 + 4 = 52$ inches tall.</p>

<p>The table shows all the heights in inches, in decreasing order.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 Using cents as a unit </span></p>

<p>The apples cost 50 cents each so three apples cost 3 $\times$ 50 cents which is 150 cents. Margie paid 5 dollars. Since one dollar is 100 cents this means that 5 dollars is 5 $\times$ 100 = 500 cents.</p>

<p>So Margie will get back $$ 500 - 150 = 350 \,{\rm cents}. $$ This is the same as \$3.50.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Using dollars and fractions </span></p>

<p>The apples cost 50 cents each. This is $\frac{1}{2}$ of a dollar. So two apples will cost 1 dollar and 3 apples cost an extra $\frac{1}{2}$ dollar making 1$\frac{1}{2}$ dollars. Margie paid 5 dollars.</p>

<p>Karl&#39;s rectangular vegetable garden is 20 feet by 45 feet, and Makenna&#39;s is 25 feet by 40 feet. Whose garden is larger in area?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 </span></p>

<p>We multiply the length and the width to find the area of each rectangular garden. Since $$20 \times 45 = 900$$ we have that Karl&#39;s garden is 900 square feet.</p>

<p>We also know that $$25 \times 40 = 1,000$$</p>

<p>so Makenna&#39;s garden is 1,000 square feet.</p>

<p>Finally, we can find the difference of the two areas</p>

<p>$$1,000 - 900 = 100$$</p>

<p>and we see that Makenna&#39;s garden is larger by 100 square feet.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: With pictures </span></p>

<p>If we draw pictures to scale, we can see this difference visually. First, draw the two rectangles to represent the two gardens; the blue rectangle represents Karl&#39;s garden and the yellow rectangle represents Makenna&#39;s garden:</p>

<p><img alt=""Sol_1_17867c1665a829e560b2222adb3dead1"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/193/large/sol_1_17867c1665a829e560b2222adb3dead1.jpg?1343168029"" /></p>

<p>Now, draw them overlapping. In the picture below, the green region shows where the rectangles overlap, the blue strip on the left shows the part of the blue rectangle that is not overlapped by the yellow rectangle, and the yellow strip on the bottom shows the part of the yellow rectangle that is not overlapped by the blue rectangle:</p>

<p><img alt=""Sol_2_10abd9cd27ec8a1b5bcf8884a08625fc"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/194/large/Sol_2_10abd9cd27ec8a1b5bcf8884a08625fc.jpg?1343168065"" /></p>

<p>Note that the blue strip is 20 feet by 5 feet and has an area of 100 square feet. The yellow strip is 40 feet by 5 feet and has an area of 200 square feet. Since $$200-100 = 100$$ we have that Makenna&#39;s garden is 100 square feet larger than Karl&#39;s garden.</p>

<p>Potential Strategies</p>

<ul>
	<li>Angle B looks like and is a right angle, and a right angle measures 90 degrees. So, angle B isn&rsquo;t the angle that measures 60 degrees. Angles C and D both have measures greater than 90 degrees, so neither angle is the angle that measures 60 degrees.

<p>We can also use a place value organizer to think about dividing 24,000 by 10.</p>

<p>We know that no matter the number in our base ten system, if we divide by 10 then every digit will shift to the right in place value. This place value organizer shows how we can represent dividing 24,000 by 10 using place value.</p>

<p><img alt=""24000divby10_724b48bf9c7893c610e96f40e55f7181"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/986/large/24000divby10_724b48bf9c7893c610e96f40e55f7181.jpg?1388591654"" /></p>

<p>Using this organizer, we can see that 24,000 divided by 10 is 2,400. Therefore, there are about 2,400 dholes.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 </span></p>

<p>There are about 24,000=20,000+4,000 maned wolves. 20,000 is ten times as many as 2,000, and 4,000 is ten times as many as 400. So there are about 2,000+400 or 2,400 dholes estimated to live in the wild.</p>

<p>We can check this:</p>

<p>$$10\times(2000+400)=10\times2,000+10\times400=20,000+4,000=24,000$$</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 </span></p>

<p>We can also use a tape diagram to show that the number of maned wolves (24,000) is ten times the number of dholes. The number of dholes must be 2,400 (which a student could then check with multiplication or repeated addition.)</p>

<p><img alt=""Tape_diagram_fe8e3828a2286a63fc77a3cdd84bc7f3"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/984/large/Tape_Diagram_fe8e3828a2286a63fc77a3cdd84bc7f3.jpg?1388591122"" /></p>

<p>For a student to use this strategy effectively, s/he would have to have some understanding of how to divide 24,000 by 10.</p>

<p>For students struggling to figure out the division, it may help to model the following thought process: &quot;Could one unit be worth 1,000 animals...2,000 animals...3,000 animals?&quot; Understanding that each unit must represent somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 animals would be a likely first step.</p>

<p>From there, the thought process might be: &quot;If we know each unit represents 2,000 animals, then we still need to account for 4,000 more animals. Could one unit contain an additional 100 animals...200 animals...300 animals...400 animals...500 animals?&quot;</p>

<p>Through this reasoning, students could come to the conclusion that each unit must represent 2,400 animals.</p>

<p>Correct if student writes 4176 in the box.</p>

<p>6,547 &ndash; 2,371 = 4,176.</p>

<p>In grade 4, students are expected to be fluent with the standard algorithms for finding sums and differences of multi-digit numbers. This is the most reliable way to calculate the difference 6,547 &ndash; 2,371. Working from right to left,</p>

<ul>
	<li>The ones digit will be 7 &ndash; 1 = 6.</li>
	<li>The tens digit will be 14 &ndash; 7 = 7.</li>
	<li>The hundreds digit will be 4 &ndash; 3 = 1.</li>
	<li>The thousands digit will be 6 &ndash; 2 = 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this problem, only the answer matters&mdash;not how the student calculated it. But if the student takes a long time to carry out the subtraction or the addition, more practice might be helpful.</p>

<p>If the student can subtract 6,547 &ndash; 2,371 but doesn&rsquo;t know what it means to check this answer by adding, then they might not understand how addition and subtraction are related. For example, if a bank vault has \$6,457 and \$2,371 of this money is stolen, then the remaining money would be \$4,176. If the money were put back (\$4,176 + \$2,371), then the total amount of money in the vault would be the original amount, \$6,547.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Jillian&#39;s reasoning is correct. She has found $20 \times 7 = 140$ and $2 \times 7 = 14$. This means that</p>

	<div>\begin{align} 18 \times 7 &amp;= (20 - 2) \times 7 \\ &amp;= (20 \times 7) - (2 \times 7) \\ &amp;= 140 - 14 \\ &amp;= 126. \end{align}</div>

	<p>The second equality uses the distributive property. These equations tell us that 126 $\div$ 7 = 18.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Jillian&#39;s initial idea of dividing 140 by 7 is represented here:</p>

	<p><img alt=""7x20_96beae94274bab0f5698cea5c5a5cf0d"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/053/large/7x20_96beae94274bab0f5698cea5c5a5cf0d.jpg?1393463349"" /></p>

	<p>From there, Jillian decomposes the 20 sevens into 18 sevens and 2 sevens:</p>

	<p><img alt=""7x182_aefea0c71879e033965c4d86b7b6135b"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/054/large/7x182_aefea0c71879e033965c4d86b7b6135b.jpg?1393463368"" /></p>

	<p>Lastly, Jillian recognizes that if the area of both rectangles combined would be 140, then she must subtract off the 2 extra sevens she used to get 140:</p>

	<p><img alt=""14014_7ae5bbe6bd9c0d94264abec059438fb1"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/055/large/14014_7ae5bbe6bd9c0d94264abec059438fb1.jpg?1393463606"" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We have $40 \times 6 = 240$ and $3 \times 6 = 18$. So</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 Comparing with benchmark fractions and using common numerators and denominators strategically </span></p>

<p>The fractions $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, and $\frac{2}{5}$ are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$: this can be seen, for example, by doubling the numerator and observing that twice the numerator is less than the denominator in all three cases. For $\frac{5}{9}$, on the other hand, twice $5$ is bigger than $9$ so if this fraction is doubled, it gives more than one and so $\frac{5}{9} &gt; \frac{1}{2}$. This tells us which of the four fractions is largest, so now we focus on comparing the other three.</p>

<p>Looking at $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{1}{3}$, we can see that $$ \frac{3}{9} \lt \frac{3}{8} $$ because 1 eighth of a whole is more than 1 ninth of the same whole, and so 3 eighths must be more than 3 ninths. But we also have $$ \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} $$ so this means that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8}$. This is a valuable piece of information, but it does not help place $\frac{2}{5}$ relative to either $\frac{3}{8}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$. Let&#39;s compare each of these fractions individually to $\frac25$.</p>

<p>There is no obvious benchmark fraction to compare $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$. However, with only two fractions we can use a common denominator: $8 \times 5 = 40$ is a natural common denominator to use. Each $\frac{1}{8}$ needs to be subdivided into $5$ equal parts to make $\frac{1}{40}$, so $$\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3\times 5}{8\times 5} = \frac{15}{40}$$ Each $\frac{1}{5}$ needs to be subdivided into $8$ equal parts to give $\frac{1}{40}$, and $$\frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\times 8}{5\times 8} = \frac{16}{40}$$ Since $$\frac{15}{40} \lt \frac{16}{40}$$ this means that $$\frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5}$$ Putting this together with the work above, we have put the four fractions in order of increasing size: $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$</p>

<p>Notice that we did not need to compare $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$ because our work shows that $\frac{3}{8}$ lies between them. If we had started by comparing $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{2}{5}$ we would have found that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{2}{5}$: this would not have told us where $\frac{3}{8}$ lies relative to $\frac{2}{5}$ since both are larger than $\frac{1}{3}$.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Common Denominator </span></p>

<p>The denominators for the fractions are $8,3,9,$ and $5$. Since 3 is a factor of 9, $$8 \times 9\times 5 = 360$$ will work as a common denominator. Since $8 \times (9\times 5) = 8 \times 45,$ we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 45 to rewrite $\frac{3}{8}$ with a denominator of $360$: $$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 45}{8 \times 45} = \frac{135}{360}. $$ For the next fraction, $\frac{1}{3}$, we have</p>

<div>\begin{align} 360 &amp;= 8 \times 9 \times 5 \\ &amp;= 8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \\ &amp;= 3 \times 8 \times 3 \times 5. \end{align}</div>
So to get $360$ as a denominator we need to multiply numerator and denominator by $8 \times 3 \times 5 = 120$: $$ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 120}{3 \times 120} = \frac{120}{360}. $$ Proceeding in the same way with $\frac{5}{9}$ we find that the denominator $9$ needs to be multiplied by $8 \times 5 = 40$ to get $360$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $40$ gives $$ \frac{5}{9} = \frac{5 \times 40}{9 \times 40} = \frac{200}{360}. $$ Finally for $\frac{2}{5}$, to get $360$ in the denominator we need to multiply by $8 \times 9 = 72$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $72$ gives $$ \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 72}{5 \times 72} = \frac{144}{360}. $$

<p>Now that we have a common denominator of $360$ the size of the fractions can be compared by looking at the size of the numerators. We have $$ \frac{120}{360} \lt \frac{135}{360} \lt \frac{144}{360} \lt \frac{200}{360} $$ because these fractions represent different numbers of equally sized parts, with $360$ of these parts in a whole. Remembering the equivalences of fractions shown above, we conclude that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}$.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 3 Common Numerator </span></p>

<p>The numerators of these fractions, $3,1,5$, and $2$, are simpler than the denominators and so finding a common numerator is a good strategy for comparing their size. Since $1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30$ we can use $30$ as a common numerator. We can then rewrite each of these fractions with $30$ as a numerator. This will mean multiplying numerator and denominator of each fraction by the appropriate number: $10$ for $\frac{3}{8}$, $30$ for $\frac{1}{3}$, $6$ for $\frac{5}{9}$, and $15$ for $\frac{2}{5}$:</p>

<div>\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &amp;= \frac{3 \times 10}{8 \times 10} = \frac{30}{80}\\ \frac{1}{3} &amp; = \frac{1 \times 30}{3 \times 30} = \frac{30}{90}\\ \frac{5}{9} &amp;= \frac{5 \times 6}{9 \times 6} = \frac{30}{54}\\ \frac{2}{5} &amp;= \frac{2 \times 15}{5 \times 15} = \frac{30}{75}. \end{align}</div>
The more equal sized pieces a whole is broken into, the smaller those pieces will be. So, ordering the unit fractions from least to greatest, we have $$ \frac{1}{90} \lt \frac{1}{80} \lt \frac{1}{75} \lt \frac{1}{54}. $$ Hence we can conclude that $$ \frac{30}{90} \lt \frac{30}{80} \lt \frac{30}{75} \lt \frac{30}{54} $$ and so $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

<p>One variation on this theme would be to observe, as in the second solution, that $\frac{5}{9}$ is the largest of the four fractions because it is larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ while the other three are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$. This makes the rest of the ordering a little easier because now, looking at $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{3}{8}$, we could employ the same method with a smaller common numerator, namely $6$. Concretely,</p>

<div>\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &amp;= \frac{3 \times 2}{8 \times 2} = \frac{6}{16}\\ \frac{1}{3} &amp; = \frac{1 \times 6}{3 \times 6} = \frac{6}{18}\\ \frac{2}{5} &amp;= \frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{6}{15}. \end{align}</div>
Reasoning as above, we see that $\frac{6}{18} \lt \frac{6}{16} \lt \frac{6}{15}$ and so once more we find that $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$</div>

Because 60/96 and 56/96 have the same denominator, students can compare them using Grade 3 methods and see that 56/96 is smaller, so 7/12 &lt; 5/8.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 Comparing with benchmark fractions and using common numerators and denominators strategically </span></p>

<p>The fractions $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, and $\frac{2}{5}$ are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$: this can be seen, for example, by doubling the numerator and observing that twice the numerator is less than the denominator in all three cases. For $\frac{5}{9}$, on the other hand, twice $5$ is bigger than $9$ so if this fraction is doubled, it gives more than one and so $\frac{5}{9} &gt; \frac{1}{2}$. This tells us which of the four fractions is largest, so now we focus on comparing the other three.</p>

<p>Looking at $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{1}{3}$, we can see that $$ \frac{3}{9} \lt \frac{3}{8} $$ because 1 eighth of a whole is more than 1 ninth of the same whole, and so 3 eighths must be more than 3 ninths. But we also have $$ \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} $$ so this means that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8}$. This is a valuable piece of information, but it does not help place $\frac{2}{5}$ relative to either $\frac{3}{8}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$. Let&#39;s compare each of these fractions individually to $\frac25$.</p>

<p>There is no obvious benchmark fraction to compare $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$. However, with only two fractions we can use a common denominator: $8 \times 5 = 40$ is a natural common denominator to use. Each $\frac{1}{8}$ needs to be subdivided into $5$ equal parts to make $\frac{1}{40}$, so $$\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3\times 5}{8\times 5} = \frac{15}{40}$$ Each $\frac{1}{5}$ needs to be subdivided into $8$ equal parts to give $\frac{1}{40}$, and $$\frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\times 8}{5\times 8} = \frac{16}{40}$$ Since $$\frac{15}{40} \lt \frac{16}{40}$$ this means that $$\frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5}$$ Putting this together with the work above, we have put the four fractions in order of increasing size: $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$</p>

<p>Notice that we did not need to compare $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$ because our work shows that $\frac{3}{8}$ lies between them. If we had started by comparing $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{2}{5}$ we would have found that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{2}{5}$: this would not have told us where $\frac{3}{8}$ lies relative to $\frac{2}{5}$ since both are larger than $\frac{1}{3}$.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Common Denominator </span></p>

<p>The denominators for the fractions are $8,3,9,$ and $5$. Since 3 is a factor of 9, $$8 \times 9\times 5 = 360$$ will work as a common denominator. Since $8 \times (9\times 5) = 8 \times 45,$ we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 45 to rewrite $\frac{3}{8}$ with a denominator of $360$: $$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 45}{8 \times 45} = \frac{135}{360}. $$ For the next fraction, $\frac{1}{3}$, we have</p>

<div>\begin{align} 360 &amp;= 8 \times 9 \times 5 \\ &amp;= 8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \\ &amp;= 3 \times 8 \times 3 \times 5. \end{align}</div>
So to get $360$ as a denominator we need to multiply numerator and denominator by $8 \times 3 \times 5 = 120$: $$ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 120}{3 \times 120} = \frac{120}{360}. $$ Proceeding in the same way with $\frac{5}{9}$ we find that the denominator $9$ needs to be multiplied by $8 \times 5 = 40$ to get $360$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $40$ gives $$ \frac{5}{9} = \frac{5 \times 40}{9 \times 40} = \frac{200}{360}. $$ Finally for $\frac{2}{5}$, to get $360$ in the denominator we need to multiply by $8 \times 9 = 72$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $72$ gives $$ \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 72}{5 \times 72} = \frac{144}{360}. $$

<p>Now that we have a common denominator of $360$ the size of the fractions can be compared by looking at the size of the numerators. We have $$ \frac{120}{360} \lt \frac{135}{360} \lt \frac{144}{360} \lt \frac{200}{360} $$ because these fractions represent different numbers of equally sized parts, with $360$ of these parts in a whole. Remembering the equivalences of fractions shown above, we conclude that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}$.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 3 Common Numerator </span></p>

<p>The numerators of these fractions, $3,1,5$, and $2$, are simpler than the denominators and so finding a common numerator is a good strategy for comparing their size. Since $1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30$ we can use $30$ as a common numerator. We can then rewrite each of these fractions with $30$ as a numerator. This will mean multiplying numerator and denominator of each fraction by the appropriate number: $10$ for $\frac{3}{8}$, $30$ for $\frac{1}{3}$, $6$ for $\frac{5}{9}$, and $15$ for $\frac{2}{5}$:</p>

<div>\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &amp;= \frac{3 \times 10}{8 \times 10} = \frac{30}{80}\\ \frac{1}{3} &amp; = \frac{1 \times 30}{3 \times 30} = \frac{30}{90}\\ \frac{5}{9} &amp;= \frac{5 \times 6}{9 \times 6} = \frac{30}{54}\\ \frac{2}{5} &amp;= \frac{2 \times 15}{5 \times 15} = \frac{30}{75}. \end{align}</div>
The more equal sized pieces a whole is broken into, the smaller those pieces will be. So, ordering the unit fractions from least to greatest, we have $$ \frac{1}{90} \lt \frac{1}{80} \lt \frac{1}{75} \lt \frac{1}{54}. $$ Hence we can conclude that $$ \frac{30}{90} \lt \frac{30}{80} \lt \frac{30}{75} \lt \frac{30}{54} $$ and so $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

<p>One variation on this theme would be to observe, as in the second solution, that $\frac{5}{9}$ is the largest of the four fractions because it is larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ while the other three are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$. This makes the rest of the ordering a little easier because now, looking at $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{3}{8}$, we could employ the same method with a smaller common numerator, namely $6$. Concretely,</p>

<div>\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &amp;= \frac{3 \times 2}{8 \times 2} = \frac{6}{16}\\ \frac{1}{3} &amp; = \frac{1 \times 6}{3 \times 6} = \frac{6}{18}\\ \frac{2}{5} &amp;= \frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{6}{15}. \end{align}</div>
Reasoning as above, we see that $\frac{6}{18} \lt \frac{6}{16} \lt \frac{6}{15}$ and so once more we find that $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$</div>

<p>The student may create a context that uses the &ldquo;groups of&rdquo; representation, for example&nbsp;saying that there are five bags, and each bag has 4 apples. Together, there are 20&nbsp;apples if you combine all of the five bags. Depending on the representations they&nbsp;choose, the student might also say that finding the area of a rectangle with side lengths&nbsp;4 units and 5 units would be an appropriate context. Students may write a multiplicative&nbsp;comparison problem; for example, &ldquo;Suzy has 4 lollipops and Lily has 5 times as many&nbsp;lollipops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Part 2.</p>

<p>Students might draw diagrams based on sets, length (such as a number line or bar&nbsp;diagrams) or area that represent&nbsp;equal groups. They also might draw a&nbsp;multiplicative comparison diagram. See&nbsp;examples below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>​We write 4 thousand as 4,000</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>40,000 is 10 times 4,000&nbsp;</p>

<p>400,000 is 10 times 40,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4,000,000 is 10 times 400,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, 400,000 = 10 $\times$ 40,000, and there are about 10 times as many fourth graders in Texas as there are in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Also, 4,000,000 = 10 $\times$ 400,000, and there are about 10 times as many fourth graders in the US as there are in Texas.</p>

<p>Finally, to go from 4,000 to 4,000,000, we have to multiply by 10 three times. We see that $$10\times10\times10=10\times100=1000$$ So there are about 1,000 times as many fourth graders in the US as there are in Washington DC.&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>If she has \$9 and tickets cost \$2 each, we divide 9 by 2 to find out how many tickets she has (this is a &quot;How many groups?&quot; division problem). $$9 &divide; 2 = 4 \text{, with a remainder of }1$$ So she could buy 4 carnival tickets with one month&#39;s allowance in 2008 and would have \$1.00 left over.</li>
	<li>As before, we divide to find how many tickets she can buy. 9 &divide; 4 = 2 with a remainder of 1. So if her allowance was \$9.00 in 2012, she could only buy 2 tickets with one month&#39;s allowance.</li>
	<li>Her allowance was \$9.00 and now it is \$14.00, and $$14 - 9 = 5$$ so her allowance increased by \$5.00.</li>
	<li>Since Tickets cost \$4 in 2012 and they cost \$2.00 in 2008, and $$4 - 2 = 2$$ a carnival ticket cost \$2.00 more in 2012 than it did in 2008.</li>
	<li>We will divide as we did in parts (a) and (b) $$14 \div 4 = 3 \text{, with a remainder of }2$$ So she could buy 3 carnival tickets with one month&#39;s allowance in 2012 and would have \$2.00 left over. Even though her allowance went up, the number of tickets she could buy went down.</li>
	<li>Since carnival tickets cost \$4.00 in 2012 and she could buy 4 tickets in 2008 , and 4 &times; 4 = 16, her allowance in 2012 would need to be at least \$16.</li>
	<li>You can buy fewer things if prices increase but your allowance doesn&rsquo;t increase.</li>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 20 students in Mr. Wolf&#39;s 4th grade class are playing a game in a hallway that is lined with 20 lockers in a row.</p>

<p><img alt=""2_eb5955ce385e777303f25f6b8c2455af"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/219/max/2_eb5955ce385e777303f25f6b8c2455af.jpg?1368797737"" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>The first student starts with the first locker and goes down the hallway and opens all the lockers.</li>
	<li>The second student starts with the second locker and goes down the hallway and shuts every other locker.</li>
	<li>The third student stops at every third locker and opens the locker if it is closed or closes the locker if it is open.</li>
	<li>The fourth student stops at every fourth locker and opens the locker if it is closed or closes the locker if it is open.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process continues until all 20 students in the class have passed through the hallway.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Which lockers are still open at the end of the game? Explain your reasoning.</li>
	<li>Which lockers were touched by only two students? Explain your reasoning.</li>
	<li>Which lockers were touched by only three students? Explain your reasoning.</li>
	<li>Which lockers were touched the most?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The lockers that are still open are perfect squares, specifically $1\times 1$, $2\times 2$, $3\times 3$, and $4\times 4$. To see why this is true, first note that:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The 1st student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 1.</li>
		<li>The 2nd student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 2.</li>
		<li>The 3rd student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 3.</li>
		<li>The 4th student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 4.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>and so on. So a locker is touched by a student if that student&#39;s number is a factor of that locker&#39;s number.</p>

	<p>Now consider the factors of 16 which are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. This means the 16th locker was opened by the 1st student, then it was closed by the 2nd student, then it was opened by the 4th student, then it was closed by the second 8th student, and then opened one last time by the 16th student. Now note that the square numbers are the only numbers with an odd number of factors (all other numbers have factors which come in pairs.) Since an odd number of factors means the locker will be changed an odd number of times, it must be open at the end.</p>

	<p>With only 20 lockers, students can simply observe this fact about the number of factors to be true for the numbers 1 to 20, which gives practice with finding factors of whole numbers. The explanation for why this is always true goes a bit beyond 4th grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The lockers that were touched by only two students are the prime numbers (since prime numbers only have two factors.) In our case they are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.</li>
	<li>The lockers which are touched by only three students are the squares of prime numbers (because these are the only numbers which have three factors.) In our case they are 4 and 9. (For example, 4 has three factors: 1, 2, and 4)</li>
	<li>The lockers which are touched the most are those lockers whose number has the most factors. In our case 12, 18, and 20 all have 6 factors, so they were each touched 6 times. $$ 12 = 1\times 12 = 2\times 6 = 3\times 4$$ $$ 18 = 1\times 18 = 2\times 9 = 3\times 6$$ $$ 20 = 1\times 20 = 2\times 10 = 4\times 5$$</li>

		<p>An even number multiplied by 2 result in an even number, because multiplying by 2 will double the number of objects. As a result, if your objects are paired off, every object will have a partner.</p>

		<li>
		<p>An even number plus 1 is odd, because an even number of objects can be paired off but adding only one more object will mean that the last object added will not have a partner: there will be one left over when you try to pair them off.</p>

		<p>Example: If we represent 12 (an even number) as two rows of six circles, and add one more circle, we can see it must be odd:</p>

		<li>
		<p>An odd number plus 1 is even, because when you have an odd number of objects and try to pair them off, one will always be left over. If you add one more object, then the lone object gains a partner, and all the objects will be in pairs.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p>The students will need grid paper and colored pencils; some color for the ships and (for example) red for explosions on their ships and their enemy&rsquo;s ships. This is how they will keep track of what ordered pairs have been called.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Students begin by folding the grid paper in half. They need to draw coordinate axes on both the top half and the bottom half and label the $x$ and $y$ axes with the numbers 1&ndash;10 on each axis. The students will need to draw in 5 ships on ordered pairs and label the ordered pairs. They should draw:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two ships that are sitting on 2 ordered pairs,</li>
	<li>One ship that is sitting on 3 ordered pairs,</li>
	<li>One ship that is sitting on 4 ordered pairs, and</li>
	<li>One ship sitting on 5 ordered pairs.</li>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>Students play in pairs sitting opposite each other and take turns calling out ordered pairs. Players should keep a list of the ordered pairs they call out written in $(x,y)$ form on a piece of paper that both players can see so there is no disagreement later on about what has been called (it is common for students to transpose the coordinates). Then they are to mark the ordered pair they call out on the top coordinate plane. They should mark in black if they missed and red if they hit their opponent&rsquo;s boat. On the bottom half of the grid paper they are to color black for the ordered pairs their opponent calls out and color red for the ordered pairs that hit their ship.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The students will be able to demonstrate understanding of ordered pairs by playing this game. The teacher can assess the students&rsquo; understanding through listening, watching, and checking the students&rsquo; work as they play with a partner. The partners will also make sure the other student is not cheating because you can reward the winner with a prize.</p>

<p>1. A rhombus is a square.</p>

<p>This is <em>sometimes</em> true. &nbsp;It is true when a rhombus has 4 right angles. &nbsp;It is not true when a rhombus does not have any right angles.</p>

<p>2. A triangle is a parallelogram.</p>

<p>This is <em>never</em> true. &nbsp;A triangle is a three-sided figure. &nbsp;A parallelogram is a four-sided figure with two sets of parallel sides.</p>

<p>3. A square is a parallelogram.</p>

<p>This is <em>always</em> true. &nbsp;Squares are quadrilaterals with 4 congruent sides and 4 right angles, and they also have two sets of parallel sides. Parallelograms are quadrilaterals with two sets of parallel sides. Since squares must be quadrilaterals with two sets of parallel sides, then all squares are parallelograms.</p>

<p>4. A&nbsp;square is a rhombus</p>

<p>This is <em>always</em>&nbsp;true. &nbsp;Squares are quadrilaterals with 4 congruent sides. &nbsp;Since rhombuses are quadrilaterals with 4 congruent sides, squares are by definition also rhombuses. &nbsp;</p>

<p>5. A parallelogram is a rectangle.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>January 1, 2011 begins at 12:00 AM. To find the time 2011 minutes later will require changing units since time is told in hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour so to see how many hours there are in 2011 minutes we can perform the division problem $2011 \div 60$. Since $30 \times 60 = 1800$, we can write $$ 2011 = 30 \times 60 + 211. $$ Next, there are three groups of&nbsp;$60$ in&nbsp;$211$, with a remainder of 31 so we get $$ 2011 = 30 \times 60 + 3 \times 60 + 31. $$ Using the distributive property this last expression is equivalent to $$ 2011 = (30 + 3) \times 60 + 31. $$ So 2011 minutes is the same as 33 hours and 31 minutes. Now 33 hours is one day and an additional 9 hours so this means that 2011 minutes is one day, nine hours, and thirty-one minutes. So 2011 minutes after the beginning of 2011 it is January 2 and it is 9:31 AM.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, the base of the tank is:</p>
	$$ 4 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet}^2 $$

	<p>Therefore,</p>

	<p>Again, the teacher should prompt students to think about what their tank would look like in real-life. A tank that is 40 feet long, 3 feet wide and 2 feet high would be very long, skinny and short. This tank would not be good for bigger fish, but it could be useful to watch something small that does not need a lot of space to move, such as a turtle.</p>

Please explain what she should do to get the correct answer and include the correct answer in your response.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marta is mistakenly trying to continue a pattern dealing with multiplying whole numbers by powers of 10: the product will have the same digits as the whole number followed by the same number of 0s as the power of 10. Marta tried to place a 0 after 84.15 in her problem to continue this pattern, but placing a 0 in the thousandths place did not change the value of 84.15. Instead, Marta can shift the decimal one place to the right so that each digit occupies ten times its original place. Her correct answer is 841.5. Another way of finding the product of 84.15 and 10 is to rewrite 84.15 in expanded notation and use the distributive property:</p>

<div>$$\begin{align} (80 + 4 + 0.1 + 0.05) \times 10 &amp;= (80 \times 10) + (4 \times 10) + (0.1 \times 10) +(0.05 \times 10) \\ &amp;= 800 + 40 + 1 + 0.5\\ &amp;= 841.5 \end{align}$$</div>

<p>Using expanded notation also highlights that the place value of each digit needs to be multiplied by a factor of 10. It should be noted that the digit 8 in the original expression represented 8 tens, but will be 8 hundreds in our product. In Marta&rsquo;s solution, the 8 still only represents 8 tens and the magnitude of the number has not changed.</p>

Students understand why multiplying by a power of 10 shifts the digits of a whole number or decimal that many places to the left. For example, multiplying by 10<sup>4</sup> is multiplying by 10 four times. Multiplying by 10 once shifts every digit of the multiplicand one place to the left in the product (the product is ten times as large) because in the base-ten system the value of each place is 10 times the value of the place to its right. So multiplying by 10 four times shifts every digit 4 places to the left. Patterns in the number of 0s in products of a whole number and a power of 10 can be explained in terms of place value.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Nine and fifty two tenths is not equivalent to 9.52. Here is one way to show that these expressions are not equivalent. Let&#39;s write out &quot;nine and fifty two tenths&quot; as 9 wholes and 52 tenths.
	<div>$$ \begin{align} 9+\frac{52}{10}&amp;=\\ 9+\frac{50}{10}+\frac{2}{10}&amp;=\\ 9+5+\frac{2}{10}&amp;=14\frac{2}{10} \end{align} $$</div>
	</li>
	<li>9 + 0.5 + 0.02 and 9.52 are equivalent. 9 + 0.5 + 0.02 shows one of the methods of writing 9.52 in expanded form.</li>
	<li>9 ones + 5 tenths + 2 hundredths is equivalent to 9.52. &quot;9 ones + 5 tenths + 2 hundredths&quot; shows the value of each digit in the number 9.52.</li>
	<li>The expression $$(9\times1)+(5\times\frac{1}{10})+(2\times\frac{1}{100})$$ is equivalent to 9.52. It is another representation of 9.52 in expanded form, showing explicitly the value of each digit in the number 9.52.</li>
	<li>952 tenths is not equivalent to 9.52. We can show this by writing 952 tenths as a fraction and then as a mixed number.
	<div>$$ \begin{align} \frac{952}{10}&amp;=\\ \frac{950}{10}+\frac{2}{10}&amp;=95\frac{2}{10} \end{align} $$</div>
	The value of 952 tenths is actually 95.2 (ten times the value of 9.52).</li>
	<li>952 hundredths is equivalent to 9.52. We can show this by writing 952 hundredths as a fraction and then as a mixed number:
	<div>$$ \begin{align} \frac{952}{100}&amp;=\\ \frac{900}{100}+\frac{52}{100}&amp;=\\ 9+\frac{52}{100}&amp;=9.52 \end{align} $$</div>

<p>If the student can divide 8,153 &divide; 31 but doesn&rsquo;t know what it means to check this answer by multiplying, then they might not understand how multiplication and division are related. For example, if we imagine that a fifth-grade class raised $8,153 for a summer field trip, to be shared equally among 31 students, then each student&rsquo;s share can be calculated by dividing: 8,153 &divide; 31 = 263. And if we multiply one student&rsquo;s share by 31, we should end up with the original amount: 31 &times; 263 = 8,153.</p>

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Niko makes \$650.35 per week and Miley makes \$440.50 per week. We know that $$650-440=210$$
	<p>and $$210.35-0.50 = 210+0.35-0.50 = 210-0.15 = 209.85$$</p>

	<p>So Niko makes \$209.85 more per week than Miley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Taylor makes \$771.25 per week and makes twice that much in two weeks.
	<p>$$2\times 771.25 = 2(700+70+1 +0.25)=1400 + 140 + 2 + 0.50$$</p>

	<p>So Taylor makes \$1542.50 in two weeks.</p>

	<p>Miley makes \$440.50 per week and so will make \$881 in two weeks. Since</p>

	<p>$$1542.50-881 = 742.50-81 = 741.50-80 = 701.50 - 40 = 661.50$$</p>

	<p>We know that Taylor will make \$661.50 more than Miley in two weeks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>There are four weeks in a month. Pinky makes \$1099.20 in a week so will make
	<p>$$4 \times 1099.20 = 4\times 1100 - 4 \times 0.80 = 4400 - 3.20 = 4396.80$$</p>

	<p>So Pinky will make \$4396.80 in a month. We can divide this by how much Miley makes in one week to find out how many weeks she will have to work.</p>

	<p>$$4396.8 \div 440.5 \approx 4400 \div 440 = 10$$</p>

	<p>So Miley will have to work about 10 weeks, or two and a half months, to earn the same amount that Pinky will make in one month.</p>

	<p>Students can also calculate a more exact answer to this question if they need some practice dividing decimals.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p>The denominators of the fractions in the first problem are 5 and 15. 5 divides evenly into 15, meaning that 15 is a multiple of 5, so 15 itself is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$. The picture below shows this:</p>

		<p><img alt=""Add_1_eb8cd8de4616283865af08357af676e4"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/254/large/Add_1_eb8cd8de4616283865af08357af676e4.jpg?1343767861"" /></p>

		<p>Here is a picture showing the fractions when they are both written in terms of fifteenths.</p>

		<p>Any multiple of 15 is also a common multiple of 5 and 15. This means that $2\times15=30$ is a common multiple and is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$. Thus, 15 and 30 are two different common denominators for the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The first common denominator that we identified in part (i) was 15. Here is a picture that represents $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}$:</p>

		<p><img alt=""Add_3_507bdcfea50ce5ec5f08d1ffbd17534c"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/257/large/Add_3_507bdcfea50ce5ec5f08d1ffbd17534c.jpg?1343769545"" /></p>

		<p>This is how we can write the process of finding this common denominator and adding using symbols:</p>

		<div>$$\begin{align} \frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}&amp;=\frac{1\times3}{5\times3}+\frac{1}{15}\\ &amp;=\frac{3}{15}+\frac{1}{15}\\ &amp;=\frac{3+1}{15}\\ &amp;=\frac{4}{15} \end{align}$$</div>

		<p>The picture shows that after we convert $\frac{1}{5}$ to $\frac{3}{15}$ we can add $\frac{1}{15}$ and we are left with $\frac{4}{15}$, as we found symbolically.</p>

		<p>The second common denominator that we identified in part (i) was 30. Here is a picture that represents $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}$:</p>

		<p><img alt=""Add_4_bb1f0fda686ff8556c3ba0caed5e9a15"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/258/large/Add_4_bb1f0fda686ff8556c3ba0caed5e9a15.jpg?1343770627"" /></p>

		<p>This is how we can write the process of finding this common denominator and adding using symbols:</p>

		<div>$$\begin{align} \frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}&amp;=\frac{1\times6}{5\times6}+\frac{1\times2}{15\times2}\\ &amp;=\frac{6}{30}+\frac{2}{30}\\ &amp;=\frac{6+2}{30}\\ &amp;=\frac{8}{30}\\ &amp;=\frac{4\times2}{15\times2}\\ &amp;=\frac{4}{15}\\ \end{align}$$</div>

		<p>The picture shows that after we convert $\frac{1}{5}$ to $\frac{6}{30}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$ to $\frac{2}{30}$ we can add the thirtieths and are left with $\frac{8}{30}$. This solution is equivalent to $\frac{4\times 2}{15\times 2}\frac{4}{15}$, as we found above. Thus, we get the same answer using the two different common denominators that we identified in part (i), as we would expect.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>In order to find the solution to the addition problem $\frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{5}$, we can first find a common denominator. 20 is a multiple of 4 and 5 because $4\times5=20$, meaning that 20 is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$. Here is a picture that shows these fractions when they are both written in terms of twentieths:</p>

		<p><img alt=""Add_5_6301e7354fbacf5c53b016071fd3e8cb"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/259/large/Add_5_6301e7354fbacf5c53b016071fd3e8cb.jpg?1343774187"" /></p>

		<p>Here is a picture that represents $\frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{5}$:</p>

		<p><img alt=""Add_6_9cafd5154afb2bf4e2fb351f81d45309"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/260/large/Add_6_9cafd5154afb2bf4e2fb351f81d45309.jpg?1343774205"" /></p>

		<p>This is how we can write the process of finding a common denominator and adding using symbols:</p>

		<div>$$\begin{align} \frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{5} &amp;=\frac{3\times5}{4\times5}+\frac{1\times4}{5\times4}\\ &amp;=\frac{15}{20}+\frac{4}{20}\\ &amp;=\frac{15+4}{20}\\ &amp;=\frac{19}{20} \end{align}$$</div>

		<p>The picture shows that when we convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to $\frac{15}{20}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$ to $\frac{4}{20}$ and add twentieths, we have $\frac{19}{20}$, as we found symbolically.</p>
		</li>
		<li>In order to solve this addition problem we again find a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{14}{8}$ and $\frac{15}{12}$. 24 is a common multiple for the denominators 8 and 12 because $8\times3=24$ and $12\times2=24$. This means that 24 is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{14}{8}$ and $\frac{15}{12}$. This is how we can write the process of finding a common denominator and adding using symbols:
		<div>$$\begin{align} \frac{14}{8}+\frac{5}{12} &amp;=\frac{14\times3}{8\times3}+\frac{5\times2}{12\times2}\\ &amp;=\frac{42}{24}+\frac{10}{24}\\ &amp;=\frac{52}{24} \end{align}$$ If we pause for a moment, we will see that $\frac{52}{24}$ is equivalent to $\frac{13}{6}$, although either representation of the sum is correct.</div>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Alternative approach to part (c) </span></p>

<p>A student with a robust understanding of fraction equivalence might note that $\frac{14}{8}$ is equivalent to $\frac{7\times 2}{4\times 2}=\frac74$. So:</p>

<p>$$\frac{14}{8}+\frac{5}{12}=\frac74+\frac{5}{12}$$</p>

<p>12 is a common denominator for these two fractions, so:</p>

<div>$$\begin{align} \frac{14}{8}+\frac{5}{12} &amp;=\frac74+\frac{5}{12}\\ &amp;=\frac{7\times3}{4\times3}+\frac{5}{12}\\ &amp;=\frac{21}{12}+\frac{5}{12}\\ &amp;=\frac{26}{12} \end{align}$$</div>

<p>Note that $\frac{26}{12}$ is equivalent to $\frac{52}{24}$ as well as $\frac{13}{6}$; any of these answers are acceptable.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>In the problem the two fractions refer to the same whole (namely the 40 acres of land). Adding the fractions is appropriate since none of the land is planted with both crops. We add and get the answer of $\frac{7}{10}$ of the 40 acres is planted in wheat or corn.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In this problem there are several aspects that make the addition of fractions wrong. First, the fractions given are of different bottles and they don&#39;t need to have any relationship to one another. Second, the question asked how much water they drank and no information is given about the amount of water in either bottle, only the fraction of what was in each bottle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In this problem, the two fractions are both parts of the same whole (the number of eggs in the incubator) and could be added together to find the fraction of the eggs that hatched in all. However, since the question asks for the number of eggs hatched, it cannot be answered without more information. Adding the fractions might be part of the solution to the question of how many eggs hatched.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In this problem, the two fractions are related to the same whole, namely the total number of members of the team. Since no one arrived after 7:10, then the question can be answered by adding the two fractions to determine that $\frac{7}{10}$ of the team arrived.</p>
	</li>

	<p>This problem may serve as a preview to a sixth grade standard relating to ratios. While Andy made $\frac{2}{5}$ of his free throws and Jose made $\frac{3}{10}$ of his free throws, the fractions are of a different number of throws and thus cannot be added. For this problem, the total fraction of free throws is the sum of the number completed out the total number attempted. Thus the total is 5 out of 15 or $\frac{5}{15}$ of the total throws.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In this problem, both of the fractions refer to the same whole, namely the total number of students in the fifth grade. However, it is likely that some of the students want to play in both groups, so it is not appropriate to add the two fractions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In this problem, the two fractions refer to the same whole, the number of students in the fifth grade. Since the rating is of their favorite sport, it is probable that each student was only allowed to select one favorite sport so that there is no overlap between the two sets. Thus it is appropriate to add the fractions to find that $\frac{7}{10}$ like one of these two sports best. Note that the total number of students in the fifth grade is given and is not necessary to answer the question. It is useful for students to see some questions where not all of the information is necessary to solve the problem.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In this problem, the two fractions are not of the same whole; rather each is a fraction of a different team. Thus it is not appropriate to add the fractions to find the fraction of the two teams that are girls. To answer the question of what fraction of the whole are girls, it would be necessary to know how many people are on each team. One would add together the number of players on the two teams to form the denominator of the new fraction. To find the number of girls on each team, one would multiply the fraction of girls on each times the number of members of the team and add together the total number of girls to get the numerator of the fraction that represents the total.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In this problem, both fractions are parts of the same whole, namely one mile, so it is appropriate to add them to find he ran a total of $\frac{7}{10}$ of a mile.</p>

","<h1>5.NF How Much Pie?</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a class potluck, Emily has three equally sized apple pies left and she wants to divide them into eight equal portions to give to eight students who want to take some pie home.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw a picture showing how Emily might divide the pies into eight equal portions. Explain how your picture shows eight equal portions.</li>
	<li>What fraction of a pie will each of the eight students get?</li>
	<li>Explain how the answer to (b) is related the division problem $3 \div 8$.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Below is a picture of how Emily might divide the three apple pies into eight equal portions. Here each color (yellow, orange, red, green, blue, dark purple, light purple, and light blue) represents one portion. So each portion consists of three pieces of pie and each piece of pie represents $\frac{1}{8}$ of a full pie:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Newpic_b3322941dd299f90e98f2c9fadedbd21"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/943/max/newpic_b3322941dd299f90e98f2c9fadedbd21.jpg?1340131491"" /></p>

	<p>Because these pies are all the same size and they are all apple pies, Emily does not need to give each student one piece of each of the three pies: two or three pieces of the same pie could go to one student. This picture, however, shows clearly that the pies have been divided into eight equal portions. If multiple pieces of a particular pie were to go to the same student, it would be necessary to analyze the picture more closely and count how many slices of pie each student received to check that it has been divided evenly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>As the picture shows, each portion consists of three slices of apple pie. Since these slices represent $\frac{1}{8}$ of a pie, this means that each student gets $\frac{3}{8}$ of an apple pie.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If 3 pies are divided into 8 equal portions, then 8 of these portions makes 3 pies, a fact that is clearly illustrated in part (a). We can write this in symbols if we use a question mark to represent the amount of pie in one portion: $$8 \times ? = 3$$ When we know a factor and the product, we can find the other factor by dividing: $$3 \div 8 = ?$$ So one person&#39;s portion is whatever we get when we divide 3 by 8. In part (b), we saw that one portion is $\frac38$. So that means that $$3 \div 8 = \frac38.$$</p>

<p>Connor said, &ldquo;I know that $\frac23 \times 3$ can be thought of as $\frac23$ of 3. Is 3 copies of $\frac23$ the same as $\frac23$ of 3?&rdquo;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw a diagram to represent $\frac23$ of 3.</li>
	<li>Explain why your picture and Makayla&rsquo;s picture together show that $3\times \frac23 = \frac23 \times 3$.</li>
	<li>What property of multiplication do these pictures illustrate?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>A rectangle of length 3 can be built from three rectangles of length 1:
	<p><img alt=""Sol_1_ad05545b4de8170b8002820be14b8cd6"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/119/large/Sol_1_ad05545b4de8170b8002820be14b8cd6.jpg?1342213458"" /></p>
	Thus, $\frac23$ of the large rectangle is 2 of the smaller rectangles of length 1.</li>
	<li>We can see in Makayla&#39;s picture that there are 3 groups of 2 thirds, so there are 6 thirds all together. Since 3 thirds is 1 whole, 6 thirds is $6\div3 =$ 2 wholes. So three rectangles each of length $\frac23$ has a total length of 2.
	<p><img alt=""Sol_2_7afc28ad980a37d23381bd6238d480fa"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/120/large/sol_2_7afc28ad980a37d23381bd6238d480fa.jpg?1342216509"" /></p>
	In the picture for part (a), we can see that $\frac23$ of 3 is also 2. So this shows that 3 groups of $\frac23$ (an interpretation of $3\times \frac23$) is equal to $\frac23$ of 3 (an interpretation of $\frac23 \times 3$), or $$3\times \frac23 = \frac23 \times 3$$</li>
	<li>These pictures illustrate the commutative property of multiplication.</li>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Carolina needs 8 quarter cups of sour cream because there are 4 quarter cups in 1 cup, and so it takes $2\times 4 = 8$ quarter cups to make 2 cups:</p>

	<p><img alt=""5.nf.7b_banana_puddi_00f2a63b41fbe572d2181641d6880025"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/545/max/5.NF.7b_Banana_Puddi_00f2a63b41fbe572d2181641d6880025.jpg?1349064093"" /></p>

	<p>This is a &quot;how many groups?&quot; division problem because it asks &quot;How many quarter cups are in 2 cups?&quot; There are two correct equations: $$2\div \frac14 = \text{ ?}$$ or equivalently: $$\text{ ?} \times \frac14 = 2$$ We can verify that 8 is the correct solution by noting that $8 \times \frac14=\frac84=2$ (4.NF.4c).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Carolina needs 16 quarter cups of milk because there are 4 quarter cups in 1 cup, and so $4\times4$ quarter cups in 4 cups, as we see in this picture:</p>

	<p><img alt=""5.nf.7b_banana_puddi_8016561c4ec86474c09d27d8bcf08689"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/546/max/5.NF.7b_Banana_Puddi_8016561c4ec86474c09d27d8bcf08689.jpg?1349064112"" /></p>

	<p>Again, this is a &quot;how many groups?&quot; division problem because it asks &quot;How many quarter cups are in 4 cups?&quot; There are two correct equations: $$4\div \frac14 = \text{ ?}$$ or equivalently, $$\text{ ?} \times \frac14 = 4$$ We can verify that 16 is the correct solution by noting that $16 \times \frac14=\frac{16}{4} = 4$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We can think of this problem several ways. First, we can ask, &quot;How many cups did I start with if I ended up with 12 quarter cups?&quot; We could write an equation for this: $$\text{? }\div \frac14 = 12$$ We could also say, &quot;I have 12 quarter cups and I want to know how many cups this is, so I can multiply 12 and $\frac14$ to find the number of cups I started with.&quot; This can be represented by the following equation: $$12 \times \frac14 =\text{ ?}$$ Notice that these two equations are equivalent and can both be interpreted in terms of the following picture:</p>

	<p><img alt=""5.nf.7b_banana_puddi_929b104b3bd88082fdfa397b0f1d0a18"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/547/max/5.NF.7b_Banana_Puddi_929b104b3bd88082fdfa397b0f1d0a18.jpg?1349064140"" /></p>

	<p>Here is yet another approach: If we note that there are 4 quarter cups in 1 cup, we can also think of this as a &quot;how many groups?&quot; division problem. We know that there are a total of 12 quarter cups and that there are 4 quarter cups in a cup (a group), and we want to know how many cups (or how many groups) this makes. Here the equation is: $$12\div4 = \text{ ?}$$ Since $12\div4 = 3$, she must have started with the vanilla pudding mix, as that is the only ingredient that requires 3 cups.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>We follow the usual order of operations and multiply before adding:</p>
	$$2\times5 + 3\times2 + 4= 10+6+4 = 20$$</li>
	<li>Before multiplying the first 2, we complete the operations inside the parentheses using oder of operations: $$2\times(5+3\times2+4)=2\times(5+6+4) = 2\times15=30$$</li>
	<li>We first complete the addition in parentheses and then follow the usual order of operations: $$2\times5+3\times(2+4)= 2\times5 +3\times6 = 10+18 = 28$$</li>
	<li>We first complete the addition in parentheses and then follow the usual order of operations: $$2\times(5+3)\times2+4=2\times 8\times 2 +4 = 32+4 = 36$$</li>
	<li>In this case the placement of parentheses does not change the value of the expression. We can remove them and see that we get the same expression as in part (a): $$(2\times5)+(3\times2)+4=2\times5+3\times2+4 = 20$$</li>
	<li>We first complete the addition in parentheses and then multiply: $$2\times(5+3)\times(2+4)=2\times 8\times6 = 96$$</li>
</ol>

<p>The five expressions aside from part (e) evaluate to different results. Therefore, we cannot remove any of the parentheses without changing the value of the expression, since doing so would give us one of the other expressions in the list. For example, if we remove the parentheses in (b) we get the expression from (a). The placement of the parentheses forces us to complete the computations in a different order than we would according to the standard order of operations.</p>

<p>Notice that the last two digits are following a simple repeating pattern: $$ 07, 49, 43, 01. $$</p>

<p>We are interested in the 2011th number in this sequence. The 2000th power will go through this sequence of 4 numbers $2000\div4=500$ times. The 2008th power will go through this sequence of 4 numbers 2 more times. Thus $7^{2009}$ will end in 07, $7^{2010}$ ends in 49 and $7^{2011}$ ends in 43. So we have an answer to both questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The ones place of $7^{2011}$ is a 3.</li>
	<li>The tens place of $7^{2011}$ is a 4.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Reasoning with place value </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>To find successive powers of 7, we can multiply by 7 repeatedly, with 2011 factors of 7 in all to get $7^{2011}$. We are only interested in the ones place and start with $7^3$ as an example:</p>

	<div>\begin{align} 7^3 &amp;= 7 \times 7^2 \\ &amp;= 7 \times 49 \\ &amp;= 7 \times (4 \times 10 + 9)\\ &amp;= (7 \times 4 \times 10) + (7 \times 9). \end{align}</div>

	<p>Since 7 $\times$ 9 = 63, the ones place of $7^3$ will be 3. Notice that the 4 tens in 49 do not play a role in determining the ones place of the product. This makes sense as these tens will only influence the higher place values in the product. So when we are looking to find the ones digit of $7^{2011}$ we only need to pay attention to the ones digit in each successive power. Starting with the first power these are $7,9,3,1$ and then the sequence repeats. Since $$2011 = 502 \times 4 + 3$$ this means that for $7^{2011}$ we will go completely through this sequence of last digits 502 times and then land on the third one which is 3. So the last digit of $7^{2011}$ is 3.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We can apply the same reasoning to find the last two digits of $7^{2011}$. Taking $7^4$ as an example, note that</p>

	<div>\begin{align} 7^4 &amp;= 7 \times 7^{3} \\ &amp;= 7 \times 343 \\ &amp;= 7 \times ( 3 \times 100 + 43) \\ &amp;= (7 \times 3 \times 100) + (7 \times 43). \end{align}</div>

	<p>As above, the only part of this expression which contributes to the tens and ones digits is $7 \times 43$. We have 7 $\times$ 43 = 301 and so the digit in the hundreds place of $7^4$ is 0 and the digit in the ones place of $7^4$ is 1. At this point we enter a nice pattern as we see by studying at $7^5 = 7 \times 7^4$: since we know $7^4$ has a zero in the hundreds place and a 1 in the ones place, when we multiply by 7 we will get a 0 in the hundreds place and a 7 in the ones place. So we will be back to where we started with the same tens digit and ones digit as $7^1$. This pattern will continue so the first, fifth, ninth (and so on) powers of 7 end in 07. Since $$2009 = 502 \times 4 + 1$$ this means that the last two digits of $7^{2009}$ are 07. For $7^{2010}$ we have to multiply by 7 so this gives 49 for the last two digits. For $7^{2011}$ we multiply by 7 again giving 43 for the last two digits.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Sam&#39;s answer is the same as discussed in task Rectangle Perimeter 1. He first added length $l$ and width $w$ and then multiplied the sum $(l+w)$ by two.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Joanna&#39;s answer is equivalent to Sam&#39;s answer. If we insert parentheses into Joanna&#39;s expression we see that $$ l+w+l+w = (l+w)+(l+w) = 2(l+w).$$</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Kiyo&#39;s expression results in different values for the same rectangle than Sam&#39;s and Joanna&#39;s expressions do. For example, for $l=2$ feet and $w=3$ feet, Sam and Joanna&#39;s expressions give a perimeter of 10 feet and Kiyo&#39;s expression gives a perimeter of 7 feet. Kiyo&#39;s expression is missing one width of the rectangle. He added the length twice ($2l$) but the width only once ($w$). If he inserted parentheses around $(l+w)$, his expression would be the same as Sam&#39;s.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Erica&#39;s expression is equivalent to both Sam&#39;s and Joanna&#39;s expressions. If in Sam&#39;s expression we use the distributive property to distribute the factor of 2, and then use the commutative property of addition to switch the order of addition, we get Erica&#39;s expression: $2(l+w) = 2l + 2w = 2w + 2l.$</p>

<blockquote>I walked Pepper for 30 miles this week!</blockquote>

<p>How long is her morning walk?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Solving an equation </span></p>

<p>If we let $w$ denote the length of the morning walk, Sierra walks $w+2.5w$ or $3.5w$ miles each day. At the end of the week she has walked 7 times as far and she said that this was 30 miles. Solving the equation $$24.5w = 30,$$ we have $w=30/24.5 \approx 1.2$ miles. Therefore the distance of Sierra&#39;s morning walk is about 1.2 miles</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Using a diagram </span></p>

<p>We can illustrate the solution to this problem with a tape diagram. If we let one box be the morning walk, then the evening walk is $2.5$ boxes. The total distance Sierra walks in one day is represented by $3.5$ boxes. Instead of talking about the number of boxes, we can choose a variable to represent the value or length of each box, say $w$.</p>

<p><img alt=""3.5w_468e6eb348f08d6dac0c020db99ea4b7"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/357/medium/3.5w_468e6eb348f08d6dac0c020db99ea4b7.jpg?1345094791"" /></p>

<p>Since Sierra walks every day of the week, the total distance walked is $7$ times as long. Therefore, we have the total distance walked during the week is $7(3.5w) = 24.5 w.$ We know that Sierra walks a total distance of 30 miles, so we have $24.5 w = 30$ miles. We can use another diagram to illustrate the total distance with $24.5$ boxes.</p>

<p><img alt=""24.5w_ea21dc912def8402c6e2e022d83a4244"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/358/max/24.5w_ea21dc912def8402c6e2e022d83a4244.jpg?1345094817"" /></p>

<p>Dividing both sides of the equation $24.5w=30$ by 24.5 allows us to find $w,$ and we have</p>

<p>$$w = 30/24.5 \approx 1.2.$$</p>

<p>Therefore, Sierra&#39;s morning walk is about 1.2 miles.</p>

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>For the Air Bounce, children must be at least 37 inches tall. If we let $h$ denote the child&#39;s height in inches, this means $h \geq 37$. They are also not allowed to be more than 61 inches tall so $h \leq 61$. We can put these two inequalities together:$$37 \leq h \leq 61.$$</p>

	<p>For the Tide Pool Climb, children are not allowed to be over 39 inches. Using $h$ for the child&#39;s height, this is represented by $$h \leq 39.$$ We could also write this as $0 \lt h \leq 39$ since a height cannot be zero or negative.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The allowable heights in inches for Air Bounce are shaded blue on the number line below (note that they include 37 inches and 61 inches). No negative numbers are included on the number line as this does not make sense for the context of height.&nbsp;</p>

	<p><br />
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/569/large/h1_2fcc994b9fb5ace348c2a221a606079a.jpg?1415994003"" /></p>

	<p>The allowable heights for Tide Pool Climb are shaded purple on the number line below:</p>

	<p><br />

	<p>Although it is not possible for a child to be close to 0 inches tall, these numbers are shaded because they fit the inequality $h \leq 39$. No negative numbers (or 0) are plotted because they do not make sense in the context of height. So the graph shows heights satisfying $0 \lt h \leq 39$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In order go on the Tide Pool Climb, a child cannot be over 39 inches in height. In order to go on the Air Bounce, a child has to be at least 37 inches tall but not more than 61 inches. So to go on both, a child must be at least 37 inches tall but not more than 39 inches: $$37 \leq h \leq 39.$$ These heights in inches are highlighted on the number line below:</p>

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Table, Formula, Graph </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>From the first row in the table, we see that the money collected, $m$, for one box sold, $b$, is \$30.00 since there are 20 candy bars in the box, which cost \$1.50 each. So, we multiply the number of boxes sold by 30 to find the amount of money collected. We fill in the remaining parts of the table as follows:</p>

	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>Boxes Sold ($b$)</th>
				<th>Money Collected ($m$)</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>\$30.00</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>\$60.00</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>\$90.00</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>\$120.00</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>\$150.00</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>\$180.00</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>7</td>
				<td>\$210.00</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>8</td>
				<td>\$240.00</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Note: We can arrive at the same amounts by repeatedly adding \$30.00 as we move down from the first row, effectively adding \$30.00 on for each box sold. As our values for $m$ and $b$ get very large in later parts of this task, addition becomes unrealistic, and multiplication is the easiest method.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using the information we found in part (a) that the amount of money collected, $m$, is equal to \$30 multiplied by the number of boxes sold, $b$, we arrive at the following equation:</p>
	$$ m = 30b $$

	<p>Since the equation represents $m$ in terms of $b$, $m$ is the dependent variable and $b$ the independent variable. In this case, we are thinking about the situation as if the amount of money collected depends on the number of boxes that are sold; this interpretation makes sense as the students are first selling the chocolate and then finding how much money they made based on how much they sold. However, we could also write the equation $$ b = m/30 $$ and think of the number of boxes sold as depending on the amount of money raised. This is especially salient when we get to questions like the one in part (e); it is easy to imagine groups with different fundraising goals asking how many boxes they will have to sell to reach their target.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If we plot the ordered pairs $(b, m)$ from the completed table in part (a), we obtain the graph below.</p>
	<img alt=""Sol_1_e408ed1570cfaf5ad2c853fb9333ba3b"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/877/max/Sol_1_e408ed1570cfaf5ad2c853fb9333ba3b.jpg?1337899450"" /></li>
	<li>
	<p>By substituting $b = 100$ into our equation from part (b), we see that</p>
	$$ m = 30(100) = 3000 $$

	<p>and so \$3,000.00 will be collected if 100 boxes of chocolate bars are sold.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We will still use our equation from part (b) for this problem, but in this situation $m$ is known, and we will be solving for $b$. Substituting $m = 1530$, we see that</p>
	$$ \begin{align} 1530 &amp;= 30b \\ \frac{1530}{30} &amp;= b \\ 51 &amp;= b \end{align} $$

	<p>Thus, the band sold 51 boxes of chocolate bars.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Table Only </span></p>

<p>It would be possible to solve the the last two parts of the problem with a table only.</p>

<ol>
	<li>See above</li>
	<li>See above</li>
	<li>See above</li>
	<li>
	<p>We can use the pattern of adding \$30 for each additional box until we get to 10 boxes and then continue in multiples of 10 boxes. Once we have the cost for 20 and 30 boxes we get 50 boxes, and we can double the amount for 50 boxes to get to 100 boxes.</p>

	<li>If Jamie lays the strips of wallpaper horizontally, can she cover the wall without wasting any wallpaper? Explain.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>One natural way to find the area of the wall is by decomposition. If we draw a horizontal line 8 feet up the wall, we break the wall into an 8 foot by 8 foot square and a triangle:</p>

	<p><br />
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/651/small/NewWallpaper2_621a641edca0968ef1d3f8e291ce2bbd.png?1424966014"" /></p>

	<p>The base of the triangle is 8 feet and its height is 2 feet. The square has an area of 64 square feet and the triangle has an area of $$\frac{8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet}}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet.}$$ So the total area of the wall is 64 + 8 = 72 square feet.</p>

	<p>Another way to find the area of the wall is to notice that we can draw an 8 foot by 10 foot rectangle around the wall. This rectangle has an area of 80 square feet. To get the wall, we remove two right triangles. Together, these make&nbsp;half of a 2 foot by 8 foot rectangle and so they have an area of 8 square feet. Hence, the area of the wall is 80 - 8 = 72 square feet.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Jamie will need to cut the strips since the top of the wall does not lay horizontally while the top of the vertical strips of wallpaper will lay horizontally. One nice way Jamie could cover the wall with vertical strips would be to make cut two 18 foot strips of paper. Each of these strips then needs to be cut &#39;&#39;diagonally,&#39;&#39; eight feet up one side and nine feet up the other side:<img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/652/small/NewWallpaper3_05e7819be7d602410ae70e7b2961e1cd.png?1424966030"" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>With horizontal strips of wallpaper, 4 strips, each 8 feet long, will cover the square part of the wall leaving the triangle at the top. Jamie can next take a 4 foot long strip of wallpaper, making a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle. If this rectangle is cut diagonally, Jamie gets two right triangles measuring 2 feet by 4 feet and these can be placed at the top of the wall:<img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/653/small/NewWallpaper4_397f91718b6d46e615ad0197d8184efc.png?1424966045"" /></p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>You are stuck in a big traffic jam on the freeway and you are wondering how long it will take to get to the next exit, which is $1 \frac12$ miles away. You are timing your progress and find that you can travel $\frac23$ of a mile in one hour. If you continue to make progress at this rate, how long will it be until you reach the exit? Solve the problem with a diagram and explain your answer.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Number Line </span></p>

<p>Using a double number line where one line is measured in miles and the other one is measure in hours we get the following diagram.</p>

<p><img alt=""Sol_1_85467de2c0283f11dcdd76b43b264f42"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/236/max/Sol_1_85467de2c0283f11dcdd76b43b264f42.jpg?1327542750"" /></p>

<p>In order to measure both $\frac12$ miles and $\frac13$ miles, we divide the 1 mile into $\frac16$ mile pieces. This way we can find $1 \frac12$ miles and $\frac23$ miles. Driving two $\frac23$ mile stretches takes two hours. That leaves $\frac16$ mile, which will take $\frac14$ hour to drive. Therefore, it takes $2 \frac14$ hours to drive $1 \frac12$ miles.</p>

<p>Since we are asking &quot;How many $\frac23$ are there in $1\frac12$?&quot; this is a &quot;How many groups?&quot; division problem: $$1\frac12\div\frac23 = ?$$ We have found that the answer to this division problem is $2\frac14$.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Linker Cubes </span></p>

<p>Using linker cubes we need at least 6 linker cubes to represent 1 mile in order to divide the mile into thirds and halves at the same time. (Note: Any multiple of 6 would also work.) So $1 \frac12$ miles is represented by 9 linker cubes and $\frac23$ of a mile is represented by 4 linker cubes. Now the question becomes: How many times do the 4 linker cubes ($\frac23$ mile) fit into the 9 linker cubes ($1 \frac12$ miles)? The answer is $1+1+\frac14 = 2 \frac14$. (see photo below)</p>

<p>Since we are asking &quot;How many $\frac23$ are there in $1\frac12$?&quot; this is a &quot;How many groups?&quot; division problem: $$1\frac12\div\frac23 = ?$$ We have found that the answer to this division problem is $2\frac14$.</p>

<p>Note: This problem could lead into a discovery of a &ldquo;common denominator&rdquo; procedure for dividing fractions: Find a common denominator of both fractions, then just divide the numerators: $1 \frac12 \div \frac23 = \frac96 \div \frac46 = 9 (\frac16) \div 4 (\frac16) = 9 \div 4 = \frac94 = 2 \frac14$.</p>

","<h1>Mile High</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Denver, Colorado is called &ldquo;The Mile High City&rdquo; because its elevation is $5280$ feet above sea level. Someone tells you that the elevation of Death Valley, California is $-282$ feet.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Is Death Valley located above or below sea level? Explain.</li>
	<li>How many feet higher is Denver than Death Valley?</li>
	<li>What would your elevation be if you were standing near the ocean?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Death Valley is located below sea level. We know this because its elevation is negative. Sea level is the base for measuring elevation. Sea level elevation is defined as 0 ft. All other elevations are measured from sea level. Those places on Earth that are above sea level have positive elevations, and those places on Earth that are below sea level have negative elevations. Thus, Death Valley, with an elevation of -282 feet, is located below sea level.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To find out how much higher Denver is than Death Valley, we can reason as follows:</p>

	<p>Death Valley is 282 feet below sea level. Denver is 5280 above sea level. So to go from Death Valley to Denver, you would go up 282 feet to get to sea level and then go up another 5280 feet to get to Denver for a total of $$282+5280 = 5562.$$ feet. Thus, Denver, Colorado is 5562 feet higher than Death Valley, California.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you were standing near the ocean, your elevation would be close to zero. Depending on how high or low the tide is and where exactly you are standing, your elevation could be as low as -50 feet (or as high as 50 feet) if you are at the edge of a very low tide (or a very high tide, respectively) at the Bay of Fundy.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alexis needs to paint the four exterior walls of a large rectangular barn. The length of the barn is 80 feet, the width is 50 feet, and the height is 30 feet. The paint costs \$28 per gallon, and each gallon covers 420 square feet. How much will it cost Alexis to paint the barn? Explain your work.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First Alexis needs to find the area she needs to paint. Alexis will need to paint two 30 foot - by - 50 foot walls and two 30 foot - by - 80 foot walls. $$2 \times 30 \textrm{ feet } \times 50 \textrm{ feet } = 3000 \textrm { square feet }$$ $$2 \times 30 \textrm{ feet } \times 80 \textrm{ feet } = 4800 \textrm { square feet }$$ Alexis will need to paint 3000 + 4800 = 7800 square feet.</p>

<p>Next, the table below shows how many square feet she can cover with different quantities of paint.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>20</td>
			<td>8400</td>

<p>20 gallons is a little more than she needs, so she can check 19 gallons and 18 gallons:</p>

</table>

<p>18 gallons isn&#39;t quite enough and 19 gallons is a bit more than she needs. Since paint is usually sold in whole gallons, it makes sense for Alexis to buy 19 gallons of paint.</p>

<p>Finally, since paint costs \$28 per gallon, the total cost will be $$19 \textrm{ gallons } \times \$28 \textrm{ per gallon } = \$532$$ It will cost Alexis \$532 to paint the barn.</p>

6.RP.A.3.a,"<p>Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with whole- number measurements, find missing values in the tables, and plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane. Use tables to compare ratios.</p>
",,,,"<p>By reasoning about ratio tables to compare ratios, students can deepen their understanding of what a ratio describes in a context and what quantities in equivalent ratios have in common. For example, suppose Abby&#39;s orange paint is made by mixing 1 cup red paint for every 3 cups yellow paing and Zack&#39;s orange paint is made by mixing 3 cups red for every 5 cups yellow. Students could discuss that all the mixtures within a single ratio table for one of the paint mixtures are the same shade of orange because they are multiple batches of the same mixture. For example, 2 cups red and 6 cups yellow is two batches of 1 cup red and 3 cups yellow; each batch is the same color, so when the two batches are combined, the shade of orange doesn&#39;t change. Therefore, to compare the colors of the two paint mixtures, any entry within a ratio table for one mixture can be compared with any entry from the ratio table for the other mixture.</p>

",,,,"<p>As students become comfortable with fractional and decimal entries in tables of quantities in equivalent ratios, they should learn to appreciate that unit rates are especially useful for finding entries.

Once students feel comfortable doing so, they may wish to work with abbreviated tables instead of working with long tables that have many values. The most abbreviated tables consist of only two columns or two rows; solving a proportion is a matter of finding one unknown entry in the table.</p>

</div>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class=""detail"">
<p>Correct if student writes 19 in the box.</p>

<p><em>A note about the units</em>. In this problem, Alisson &ldquo;weighs&rdquo; the stones in units of grams. However, grams are actually a unit of mass, not a unit of weight. If the student has learned the difference between mass and weight, you may want to clarify that, in this problem, Alisson is actually finding the stones&rsquo; mass, not their weight. The problem uses the everyday language of weight in case students are not yet familiar with the scientific concept of mass or the physics distinction between mass and weight. In this solution, we&rsquo;ll use the terms mass and weight as if they were synonymous.</p>

<p>The mean, or average, value is a single number that can be used to summarize a set of measurements. To calculate the mean value, add together the 8 data values, and then divide by 8.</p>

<p><strong>Total</strong>: 15 + 15 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 42 = 152 grams</p>

<p><strong>Mean value</strong>: 152 &divide; 8 = 19 grams.</p>

<p>On average, a stone in this collection weighs 19 grams. Note that 19 grams is greater than the smallest value (10 grams) and less than the greatest value (42 grams). The mean value lies between the extremes.</p>

<p>Looking at the line plot, notice that there is a main group of weights in the range from 15 to 20 grams; the mean value is located in this part of the line plot where many values are clustering together.</p>

<p>Even though, on average, a stone in this collection weighs 19 grams, no stone in the collection actually weighs 19 grams.</p>

<p>One way to interpret a mean of 19 grams is to say that if you had 8 identical stones, each weighing 19 grams, then together they would weigh the same as the 8 stones that were actually measured. On this interpretation, the mean value &ldquo;equalizes&rdquo; the variation in the stones&rsquo; weights. An equivalent way to interpret a mean of 19 grams is to say that if the total of 152 grams were shared equally among the stones, then each stone would weigh 19 grams. So 19 grams is a fair-share weight.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://achievethecore.org/content/upload/6.SP.B.5%20Image4.PNG"" style=""float:left; height:132px; width:404px"" /></p>

<p>Yet another way to look at the mean is that the mean tells you the &ldquo;balance point&rdquo; on a line plot. If you imagine the line plot as being like a teetertotter on the playground (with each of the X&rsquo;s being like little kids), then locating the pivot point of the teeter-totter at exactly 19 grams brings the two sides into balance. This interpretation of the mean relies on physics principles that students may learn later in high school. (Note, in the teeter-totter analogy, all eight of the &ldquo;kids&rdquo; weigh the same amount.)</p>

<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the one unusually heavy stone (42 grams), then the mean value would have been pretty close to 15 grams. (In terms of the teeter-totter idea, if we take away the X at 42 grams, then the balance point of the remaining X&rsquo;s would be very near 15 grams.) The presence of the unusually heavy stone &ldquo;raises the average&rdquo; from 15 grams all the way up to 19 grams.</p>

<p>The unusually high value of 42 grams is sometimes called an <em>outlier</em>. Sometimes people remove outliers from the data before they calculate a mean value; in this case, however, the value 42 was kept because there is no reason to believe that the measurement was done incorrectly. The eight stones in the collection have a mean weight of 19 grams.</p>

","<h1>7.G Stained Glass</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The students in Mr. Rivera&#39;s art class are designing a stained-glass window to hang in the school entryway. The window will be 2 feet tall and 5 feet wide. They have drawn the design below:</p>

<p><img alt=""1_745c7d05e1fdafd29cf6e8e5ca7f8117"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/252/max/1_745c7d05e1fdafd29cf6e8e5ca7f8117.jpg?1368919434"" /></p>

<p>They have raised \$100 for the materials for the project. The colored glass costs \$5 per square foot and the clear glass costs \$3 per square foot. The materials they need to join the pieces of glass together costs 10 cents per foot and the frame costs \$4 per foot.</p>

<p>Do they have enough money to cover the costs of the materials they will need to make the window?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are many ways to do this. Here is one:</p>

<p>Assume that the students only have to pay for the glass they use and not the scraps that they would cut away. That means we need to figure out the area of the colored glass and the area of the clear glass as well as the total length of the seams between the panels of glass.</p>

<p>First, we need to find the area of the clear glass and the area of the colored glass.</p>

<p>The entire rectangle is 2 feet by 5 feet. Assuming that the curves are all parts of a circle with a 1 foot diameter, there are five 1 by 2 foot rectangles with either 4 half-circles or 2 half circles and 4 quarter circles of clear glass. That means there are 2 full circles of clear glass in each 1 by 2 foot rectangle. Thus, there are 10 complete circles of clear glass, each with a 1 foot diameter (or a $\frac12$ foot radius). Then area of the entire window is 10 square feet, and the area of the clear glass is</p>

<p>$$10\times \pi (\frac12)^2= \frac52\pi$$</p>

<p>or approximately 7.9 square feet. That means the area of colored glass is approximately 10 - 7.9 = 2.1 square feet.</p>

<p>Now we need to find the total length of the &quot;seams&quot; between the pieces of glass.</p>

<p>Again, there are 10 circles. Their total circumference is</p>

<p>$$10\times \pi\times1$$</p>

<p>which is about 31.4 feet. There are also four 2-foot straight &quot;seams.&quot; So all together there are about 39.4 feet of &quot;seams.&quot;</p>

<p>The frame is 2+2+5+5 = 14 feet.</p>

<p>The cost for the clear glass is $7.9 \times 3 = 23.70$ dollars.</p>

<p>The cost for the colored glass is $2.1 \times 5 = 10.50$ dollars.</p>

<p>The cost for the materials for the seams is $39.4 \times 0.10 = 3.94$ dollars.</p>

<p>The cost of the frame is $14\times4=56$ dollars.</p>

<p>The total cost of the materials is $23.70+10.50+3.94+56\approx 94$ dollars. So if these assumptions are accurate, they have just enough money to buy the materials. If they need to pay for the scraps or if they break pieces as they go, they don&#39;t have much wiggle room.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fishing Adventures rents small fishing boats to tourists for day-long fishing trips. Each boat can only carry 1200 pounds of people and gear for safety reasons. Assume the average weight of a person is 150 pounds. Each group will require 200 lbs of gear for the boat plus 10 lbs of gear for each person.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create an inequality describing the restrictions on the number of people possible in a rented boat. Graph the solution set.</li>
	<li>Several groups of people wish to rent a boat. Group 1 has 4 people. Group 2 has 5 people. Group 3 has 8 people. Which of the groups, if any, can safely rent a boat? What is the maximum number of people that may rent a boat?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Let $p$ be the number of people in a group that wishes to rent a boat. Then $150p$ represents the total weight of the people in the boat, in pounds. Also, $10p$ represents the weight of the gear that is needed for each person on the boat. So the total weight in the boat that is contributed solely by the people is $$150p+10p=160p$$ Because each group requires 200 pounds of gear regardless of how many people there are, we add this to the above amount. We also know that the total weight cannot exceed 1200 pounds. So we arrive at the following inequality: $$160p+200\leq 1200$$ A graph illustrating the solutions is shown below. We observe that our solutions are values of $p$, listed below the number line and shown by the blue dots, so that the corresponding weights $160 p+ 200$, listed above the line, are below the limit of $1200$ lbs.
	<p><img alt=""Fishing_4_d0cee9e2b0cbdf3da4934359506c64e6"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/783/max/fishing_4_d0cee9e2b0cbdf3da4934359506c64e6.jpg?1335066332"" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>We can find out which of the groups, if any, can safely rent a boat by substituting the number of people in each group for $p$ in our inequality. We see that $$\mbox{For Group 1}: 160(4)+200=840\leq 1200$$ $$\mbox{For Group 2}: 160(5)+200=1000\leq1200$$ $$\mbox{For Group 3}: 160(8)+200=1480\not\leq1200$$ We find that both Group $1$ and Group $2$ can safely rent a boat, but that Group $3$ exceeds the weight limit, and so cannot rent a boat.
	<p>To find the maximum number of people that may rent a boat, we solve our inequality for $p$:</p>

	<p>$$ 160p+200\leq1200 $$ $$160p\leq1000$$ $$p\leq6.25$$</p>

	<p>As we cannot have .25 person, we see that 6 is the largest number of people that may rent a boat at once. This also matches our graph; since only integer values of $p$ make sense, 6 is the largest value of $p$ whose corresponding weight value lies below the limit of $1200$ lbs.</p>

Some maps, e.g., the Mercator projection of the Earth, distort distances or land areas and are thus not scale drawings. Likewise, technical drawings and photographs of three-dimensional objects that require a distortion in scale and are not scale drawings. Three-dimensional objects can be represented without distortion by scale models such as doll houses, model trains, architectural models, and souvenirs. Students compute or estimate lengths in the real object by computing or measuring lengths in the drawing and multiplying by the scale factor. They investigate: What is the same and what is different about the scale drawings and their original counterparts? Angles in a scale drawing are the same as the corresponding angles in the real object. Lengths are not the same, but differ by a constant scale factor.</p>

<p>By sketching geometric shapes that obey given conditions, students lay the foundation for the concepts of congruence and similarity in Grade 8, and for the practice of geometric deduction that will grow in importance throughout the rest of their school careers. For example, given three side lengths, perhaps in the form of physical or virtual rods, students try to construct a triangle. Two important possibilities arise: there is no triangle or there is exactly one triangle. By examining many situations where there is no triangle, students can identify the culprit: one side that is longer than the other two put together. From this they can reason that in a triangle the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.</p>

<p>Comment: In Grade 7, students have not had the Pythagorean theorem, so they are not expected to determine that the rectangle has sides of 1 and $\sqrt{2}$. They should, however, note that the diagonal of a face is longer than the edge, hence the cross section is not a square.</p>

<p>b. An equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>Comment: Because the three sides of the cross-section are all the diagonals of the faces, they have the same length.

<p>Comment: This one is by far the most challenging of the three. A key insight is to figure out where the plane intersects the edges CF and BE. Many people have a great deal of difficulty visualizing the shape. However, students using clay or paper models can figure it out. Although it is not expected for 7th grade students to be able to determine the exact coordinates (it ends up that the intersections are ⅔ the way up the edge), students can estimate that it is more than halfway, and be able to make an argument that the resulting shape has five sides and not all the sides have the same length, hence it is an irregular pentagon.</p>

<p>Students have been long familiar with circles and now they undertake a calculation of their perimeters and areas. This is a step forward from their previous methods of calculating area by decomposing figures into rectangles and triangles. Students must now grapple with the meaning of the area of a figure with curved boundary. The area can be estimated by superimposing a square grid and counting squares inside the figure, with the estimate becoming more and more accurate as the grid is made finer and finer.</p>

7.G.B.5,"<p>Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve simple equations for an unknown angle in a figure.</p>
",,,,"<p>In Grade 7, students build on earlier experiences with angle measurement (see the Grade 4 section of the Geometric Measurement Progression) to solve problems that involve<em> supplementary angles, complementary angles, vertical angles, and adjacent angles</em>. Vertical angles have the same number of degrees because they are both supplementary to the same angle. Keeping in mind that two geometric figures are &ldquo;the same&rdquo; in Grade 7 if one can be superimposed on the other, it follows that angles that are the same have the same number of degrees. Conversely, if two angles have the same measurement, then one can be superimposed on the other, so having the same number of degrees is a criterion for two angles to be the same. An angle is called a <em>right angle</em> if, after extending the rays of the angle to lines, it is the case that all the angles at the vertex are the same. In particular, the measurement of a right angle is 90&deg;. In this situation, the intersecting lines are said to be <em>perpendicular</em>. Knowledge of angle measurements allows students to use algebra to determine missing information about particular geometric figures, using algebra in the service of geometry, rather than the other way around.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 7th graders at Sunview Middle School were helping to renovate a playground for the kindergartners at a nearby elementary school. City regulations require that the sand underneath the swings be at least 15 inches deep. The sand under both swing sets was only 12 inches deep when they started.</p>

<p>The rectangular area under the small swing set measures 9 feet by 12 feet and required 40 bags of sand to increase the depth by 3 inches. How many bags of sand will the students need to cover the rectangular area under the large swing set if it is 1.5 times as long and 1.5 times as wide as the area under the small swing set?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Finding the scale factor the hard way </span></p>

<p>3 inches is $\frac14=0.25$ foot, so the volume of sand that was used is $$0.25 \times 9 \times 12 = 27$$ cubic feet. The amount of sand needed for an area that is 1.5 times as long and 1.5 times as wide would be $$0.25 \times (1.5 \cdot 9) \times (1.5 \cdot \times 12) = 60.75$$ cubic feet.</p>

<p>We know that 40 bags covers 27 cubic feet. Since the amount of sand for the large swing set is $$60.75 \div 27 = 2.25$$ times as large, they will need 2.25 times as many bags. Since $2.25 \times 40 =90$, they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Finding the scale factor the easy way </span></p>

<p>Since we have to multiply both the length and the width by 1.5, the area that needs to be covered is $$1.5^2 = 2.25$$ times as large. Since the depth of sand is the same, the amount of sand needed for the large swing set is 2.25 times as much as is needed for the small swing set, and they will need 2.25 times as many bags. Since $2.25 \times 40 =90$, they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Using a unit rate </span></p>

<p>The area they cover under the small swing set is $9 \times 12 = 108$ square feet. Since the depth is the same everywhere, and we know that 40 bags covers 108 square feet, they can cover $108 \div 40 = 2.7$ square feet per bag.</p>

<p>The area they need to cover under the large swing set is $$1.5^2 = 2.25$$ times as big as the area under the small swing set, which is $$2.25 \times 108 = 243$$ square feet. If we divide the number of square feet we need to cover by the area covered per bag, we will get the total number of bags we need: $$243 \div 2.7 = 90$$ So they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: The other unit rate </span></p>

<p>The area they cover under the small swing set is $9 \times 12 = 108$ square feet. Since the depth is the same everywhere, and we know that 40 bags covers 108 square feet, they can cover $40 \div 108 = \frac{10}{27}$ bags per square foot.</p>

<p>The area they need to cover under the large swing set is $$(\frac32)^2 = \frac94$$ times as big as the area under the small swing set, which is $$\frac94 \times 108 = 243$$ square feet. If we multiply the number of square feet they need to cover by the number of bags needed per square foot, we will get the total number of bags we need: $$243 \times \frac{10}{27}= 90$$ So they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

<p>In Grade 7, students extend the use of geometric terms and definitions with which they have become familiar: polygons, perimeter, area, volume and surface area of two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects, etc. They continue to apply their knowledge in order to solve problems. In Grade 6, students found the area of a polygon by decomposing it into triangles and rectangles whose areas they could calculate, making use of structure (MP.7) in order to reduce the original problem to collections of simpler problems (MP.1). Now they apply the same sort of reasoning to three-dimensional figures, dissecting them in order to calculate their volumes.</p>

		<p>His new account balance is -\$6.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>He started with an account balance of -\$6 and paid the debt off so his account balance is 0. If $d$ is the amount money he deposited to pay off his debt, then $$-6 + d = 0$$ <img alt=""4_5adb2c4892f6908c75fb8cacd77a3988"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/019/max/4_5adb2c4892f6908c75fb8cacd77a3988.jpg?1363724976"" /></p>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It makes sense to use a negative number to represent Evan&#39;s account balance when he owes money. Here are two ways to look at it:</p>

	<p>(1) We always take the current account balance and add a positive number to that if he makes a deposit or subtract a positive number from that if he buys items at the bookstore. If he spends more than he has in his account, then we are subtracting a bigger number from a smaller number, and the result is negative.</p>

	<p>(2) We can also see in this context that if he deposits just enough money to pay off his debt, that means we are adding a positive number to his account balance and the result is 0. If you add two numbers together to get 0, then the numbers must be opposites. The opposite of a positive number is a negative number, so it makes sense to represent his account balance with a negative number when he owes money to the bookstore.</p>

<p>Some people define $3\times5$ as $5+5+5$, which has a value of $15$.</p>

	<li>
	<p>If we use the same definition for multiplication, what should the value of $3\times(-5)$ be?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Here is an example of the distributive property: $$3\times(5+4)=3\times5+3\times4$$</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The value of $3\times (-5)$ should be $(-5)+(-5)+(-5) = -15$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Applying the distributive property gives $$3\times(5+(-5))=3\times5+3\times(-5).$$ Since $5+(-5)=0$ and $3\times5=15$,</p>

	<div>$$\begin{align} 3\times0=&amp;3\times (5+(-5))\\ =&amp;3\times5+3\times(-5)\\ =&amp;15+3\times(-5) \end{align}$$</div>
	Since $3\times 0 = 0$, these equations show that $0 = 15+ 3\times(-5)$. From here, we see that $3\times(-5)=-15$.

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Extending the commutative property of multiplication to negative numbers, the product $(-5)\times3$ should have the same value as $3 \times (-5)$ so it should be -15. Furthermore, the distributive property gives $(-5)\times(3+(-3)) = (-5)\times3 + (-5)\times(-3)$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using the equality from part (c), $$(-5)\times(3+(-3)) = (-5)\times3 + (-5)\times(-3),$$ we know the left side is 0 and we know $(-5)\times3 = -15$. So $$0 = -15 + (-5)\times(-3)$$ and $(-5)\times(-3) = 15$.</p>

	<li>Why do we make the choice of saying that a negative times a negative is positive? Because we want to extend the operation of multiplication to rational numbers in such a way that all of the properties of operations are satisfied. In particular, the property that really makes a difference here is the distributive property. If you want to be able to say that 4 x (5 + -2) = 4 x 5 + 4 x -(2).</li>
	<li>Just as the relationship between addition and subtraction helps students understand subtraction of rational numbers, so the relationship between multiplication and division helps them understand division.To calculate -8 divided by 4, students recall that (-2) x 4 = -8, and so -8 divided by 4 = -2. By the same reasoning, -8 divided by 5 = -8/5 because -8/5 x 5 = -8.</li>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All together, the students collected $3,760 + 2,301 + 1,855 = 7,916$ box tops.</p>

<p>Mr. Aceves&rsquo; class collected $\displaystyle \frac{3760}{7916}$ of the box tops.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baca&rsquo;s class collected $\displaystyle \frac{2301}{7916}$ of the box tops.</p>

<p>Mr. Canyon&rsquo;s class collected $\displaystyle \frac{1855}{7916}$ of the box tops.</p>

<p>The amount for Mr. Aceves&rsquo; class is $\displaystyle \frac{3760}{7916} \times 600 \approx 284.99$</p>

<p>The amount for Mrs. Baca&rsquo;s class is $\displaystyle \frac{2301}{7916} \times 600 \approx 174.41$</p>

<p>The amount for Mr. Canyon&rsquo;s class is $\displaystyle \frac{1855}{7916} \times 600 \approx 140.60$</p>

","<h1>7.RP and 7.G Sand Under the Swing Set</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 7th graders at Sunview Middle School were helping to renovate a playground for the kindergartners at a nearby elementary school. City regulations require that the sand underneath the swings be at least 15 inches deep. The sand under both swing sets was only 12 inches deep when they started.</p>

<p>The rectangular area under the small swing set measures 9 feet by 12 feet and required 40 bags of sand to increase the depth by 3 inches. How many bags of sand will the students need to cover the rectangular area under the large swing set if it is 1.5 times as long and 1.5 times as wide as the area under the small swing set?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Finding the scale factor the hard way </span></p>

<p>3 inches is $\frac14=0.25$ foot, so the volume of sand that was used is $$0.25 \times 9 \times 12 = 27$$ cubic feet. The amount of sand needed for an area that is 1.5 times as long and 1.5 times as wide would be $$0.25 \times (1.5 \cdot 9) \times (1.5 \cdot \times 12) = 60.75$$ cubic feet.</p>

<p>We know that 40 bags covers 27 cubic feet. Since the amount of sand for the large swing set is $$60.75 \div 27 = 2.25$$ times as large, they will need 2.25 times as many bags. Since $2.25 \times 40 =90$, they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Finding the scale factor the easy way </span></p>

<p>Since we have to multiply both the length and the width by 1.5, the area that needs to be covered is $$1.5^2 = 2.25$$ times as large. Since the depth of sand is the same, the amount of sand needed for the large swing set is 2.25 times as much as is needed for the small swing set, and they will need 2.25 times as many bags. Since $2.25 \times 40 =90$, they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Using a unit rate </span></p>

<p>The area they cover under the small swing set is $9 \times 12 = 108$ square feet. Since the depth is the same everywhere, and we know that 40 bags covers 108 square feet, they can cover $108 \div 40 = 2.7$ square feet per bag.</p>

<p>The area they need to cover under the large swing set is $$1.5^2 = 2.25$$ times as big as the area under the small swing set, which is $$2.25 \times 108 = 243$$ square feet. If we divide the number of square feet we need to cover by the area covered per bag, we will get the total number of bags we need: $$243 \div 2.7 = 90$$ So they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: The other unit rate </span></p>

<p>The area they cover under the small swing set is $9 \times 12 = 108$ square feet. Since the depth is the same everywhere, and we know that 40 bags covers 108 square feet, they can cover $40 \div 108 = \frac{10}{27}$ bags per square foot.</p>

<p>The area they need to cover under the large swing set is $$(\frac32)^2 = \frac94$$ times as big as the area under the small swing set, which is $$\frac94 \times 108 = 243$$ square feet. If we multiply the number of square feet they need to cover by the number of bags needed per square foot, we will get the total number of bags we need: $$243 \times \frac{10}{27}= 90$$ So they will need 90 bags of sand for the large swing set.</p>

Skateboard problem 2. A SuperSick skateboard costs $140 now, but its price will go up by 20%. What will the new price be after the increase?<br />
The solutions to these two problems are different because the 20% refers to different wholes or 100% amounts. In the first problem, the 20% is 20% of the larger pre-discount amount, whereas in the second problem, the 20% is 20% of the smaller pre-increase amount. Notice that the distributve property is implicitly involved in working with percent decrease and increase. For example, in the first problem, if x is the original price of the skateboard (in dollars), then after the 20% discount, the new price is x - 20% * x. The distributive property shows that the new price is 80% * x<br />
<br />
x - 20% * x = 100% * x - 20% * x = (100% - 20%)x = 80% * x</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a poll of Mr. Briggs&rsquo;s math class, 67% of the students say that math is their favorite academic subject. The editor of the school paper is in the class, and he wants to write an article for the paper saying that math is the most popular subject at the school.

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is unlikely that Mr. Briggs&rsquo;s math class is a representative of all students at the school. For example, Mr. Briggs may be a particularly good (or entertaining) teacher, or he may pass out candy every day, or this class might be an advanced elective. Perhaps the students responded positively in hopes of pleasing their teacher. A better way to gather data would be to take a random sample of 25 students from all students at the school, so that it would be more representative of the population of interest. Among other options, this could be done by assigning a random number to every student from 1 to $N$, where $N$ is the number of students at the school. Then a random digits table or a calculator could be used to select 25 random numbers between 1 to $N$ for the sample.</p>

	<li>Should we be concerned that none of the samples had a red marble percentage of exactly 33.6% even though that value is the true red marble percentage for the whole jar? Explain briefly why a guest can&#39;t obtain a sample red marble percentage of 33.6% for a random sample of size 16.</li>
	<li>Recall that the hotel employee who made the table and dotplot above didn&#39;t know that the real percentage of red marbles in the entire jar was 33.6%. If another person thought that half of the marbles in the jar were red, explain briefly how the hotel employee could use the dotplot and table results to challenge this person&#39;s claim. Specifically, what aspects of the table and dotplot would encourage the employee to challenge the claim?</li>
	<li>Design a simulation that takes a large number of samples of size 16 from a population in which 65% of the members of the population have a particular characteristic. For each sample of size 16, compute the percentage of red items in the sample. Record these percentages, and then summarize all of your sample percentages using a table and dotplot similar to those shown above. In what ways is your dotplot similar to the dotplot used in this task? In what ways does it differ?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Since any estimate from 24.6% to 42.6% will be considered a winner, all of the estimates of 25%, 31.25%, and 37.5% would be the &quot;winners.&quot; From the table or dotplot, that would be 15 + 22 + 20 respectively, which would make for a total of 57 winning estimates.</li>
	<li>From the table or dotplot, an estimate that is &quot;more than half&quot; would be any estimate of 56.25%, 62.5%, or 68.75%. That would be 4 + 2 + 1 respectively, which would make for a total of 7 estimates which have values that correspond to &quot;more than half red.&quot;</li>
	<li>In this case, the estimate from any random sample of 16 marbles will always be of the form $\frac{X}{16}$ where $X$ is a discrete value from $0, 1, 2, \ldots 16$. None of those possible proportions can equal exactly 33.6%; the closest possible sample percentage is 31.25% ($= \frac{5}{16}$) which happens to be the most frequent estimate in the table. Alternatively, $0.336 \cdot 16 = 5.376$, and it is not possible to draw 5.376 red marbles as the number of reds drawn must be a whole number between 0 and 16 (inclusive).</li>
	<li>Under the assumption that the random samples are representative of the population from which they were selected, if half of the marbles in the glass jar were red, then the dotplot and table would most likely show a majority of sample values centered near 50%. We notice from the collected data that most of the sample estimates are in the 25% to 43.75% range, and the graph seems to be centered more in the low-30% values. Other arguments that discuss how the graph is centered at a value far from 50% and/or how a small number of the estimates are actually near 50% would also be appropriate.</li>
	<li>Regardless of simulation method, the distribution of the sample percentages should be centered between 60 and 70% and have a spread and approximate shape that are similar to the graph shown earlier in this task. In some respects, the distribution should resemble a &quot;mirror image&quot; of the distribution shown in this task.</li>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>College football teams are grouped with similar teams into &quot;divisions&quot; (and in some cases, &quot;subdivisions&quot;) based on many factors such as game attendance, level of competition, athletic department resources, and so on. Schools from the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly known as Division 1-A) are typically much larger schools than schools of any other division in terms of enrollment and revenue. &quot;Division III&quot; is a division of schools with typically smaller enrollment and resources.</p>

<p>One particular position on a football team is called &quot;offensive lineman,&quot; and it is generally believed that the offensive linemen of FBS schools are heavier on average than the offensive linemen of Division III schools.</p>

<p>For the 2012 season, the University of Mount Union Purple Raiders football team won the Division III National Football Championship while the University of Alabama Crimson Tide football team won the FBS National Championship. Below are the weights of the offensive linemen for both teams from that season.</p>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Correct if student selects the third of the three bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third bag gives the greatest probability of drawing a red marble. There are many ways to decide which probability is greater, $\frac 35$ or $\frac 23$:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rewrite the fractions as decimals to see that 0.66... is greater than 0.6.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Rewrite the fractions with a common denominator to see that $\frac{10}{15}$&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;$\frac{9}{15}$&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Subtract $\frac 23$ &ndash; $\frac 35$ = $\frac{1}{15}$&nbsp;&nbsp; to see that $\frac 23$ is greater than $\frac 35$ by that amount.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Divide $\frac 23$ by $\frac 35$ and see how the answer compares to 1:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>$$\frac 23&nbsp;&divide; \frac 35$$</p>

<p>$$= \frac 23&nbsp;&times; \frac 53$$</p>

<p>$$= \frac{10}{9}$$</p>

<p>This is greater than 1, so $\frac 23$ &gt; $\frac 35$.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If students get the right answer, you might ask how they thought about the problem. If students are having trouble with the problem, you might ask a warmup question: for example, ask what they think about the second bag. They should be able to interpret &ldquo;0&rdquo; as meaning that there is no chance of winning a prize with the second bag. Evidently there are no red marbles in that bag!&nbsp;</p>

<p>A follow-up question could be to ask the student what the probabilities are of not winning a prize, for each of the three bags. (Answers: $\frac 25$, 1, $\frac 13$) You could also ask: for any of these bags, are you more likely to win a prize or more likely not to win a prize?&nbsp;</p>

Similarly, when red plays blue, the probability that blue will win is $$\frac{25}{36}\approx 0.69$$ so blue is more likely to beat red after playing many rounds.</li>
	<li>It is better to choose your die second because if your opponent goes first, you can always choose a die that is more likely to beat the die he or she chose.

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this problem $c$ represents a positive number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quotient rule for exponents says that if $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m&gt;n$, then $$\frac{c^m}{c^n} = c^{m-n}.$$ After explaining to yourself why this is true, complete the following exploration of the quotient rule when $m\leq n$:</p>

<ol>
	<li>What expression does the quotient rule provide for $\frac{c^m}{c^n}$ when $m =n$?</li>
	<li>If $m = n$, simplify $\frac{c^m}{c^n}$ without using the quotient rule.</li>
	<li>What do parts (a) and (b) above suggest is a good definition for $c^0$?</li>
	<li>What expression does the quotient rule provide for $\frac{c^0}{c^n}$?</li>
	<li>What expression do we get for $\frac{c^0}{c^n}$ if we use the value for $c^0$ found in part (c)?</li>
	<li>Using parts (d) and (e), propose a definition for the expression $c^{-n}$.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>If we apply the quotient rule for exponents when&nbsp;$m = n$, we find \begin{align}\frac{c^m}{c^n} &amp;= \frac{c^m}{c^m} \\ &amp;=c^{m-m}\\ &amp;= c^0.\end{align}</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Without the quotient rule, when $m = n$, we have $\frac{c^m}{c^m} = 1$.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Parts (a) and (b) give a compelling justification for choosing to define $c^0=1$ for any positive number $c$. &nbsp;Namely, on the one hand, $\frac{c^m}{c^m}$ is 1 by doing the explicit division. On the other hand, the extension of the quotient rule to the case $m=n$ gives $\frac{c^m}{c^m}=c^0$. &nbsp;If we want the quotient rule to continue hold in this case, we are <em>forced</em> to define $c^0=1$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If we apply the quotient rule for exponents when&nbsp;$m = 0$, we find \begin{align}\frac{c^0}{c^n} &amp;= c^{0-n}\\ &amp;= c^{-n}.\end{align} We have a negative exponent in this case.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>According to part (c), $c^0 = 1$. If we substitute this into the fraction $\frac{c^0}{c^n}$ we find that $\frac{c^0}{c^n} = \frac{1}{c^n}$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Much like our definition for $c^0$, the previous two parts dictate that if we want the quotient rule to hold for the expression $\frac{c^0}{c^n}$, we are forced to define $c^{-n} = \frac{1}{c^n}$. That is, the quotient rule suggests we should define raising the number $c$ to a negative power to be the reciprocal of the corresponding positive power.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is said that the average person blinks about 1000 times an hour. This is an <em>order-of-magnitude</em> estimate, that is, it is an estimate given as a power of ten. Consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100 blinks per hour, which is about two blinks per minute.</li>
	<li>10,000 blinks per hour, which is about three blinks per second.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these are reasonable estimates for the number of blinks a person makes in an hour. Make order-of-magnitude estimates for each of the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Your age in hours.</li>
	<li>The number of breaths you take in a year.</li>
	<li>The number of heart beats in a lifetime.</li>
	<li>The number of basketballs that would fill your classroom.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can you think of others questions like these?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>For this problem, the students must convert an age in years to an age in hours. For example, a 13-year-old student would calculate their age in hours in the following way: $$ 13 \text{ years} \times 365 \frac{\text{days}}{\text{year}} \times 24 \frac{\text{hours}}{\text{day}} = 113,880 \text{ hours}. $$ Now we note that 113,880 hours is between 100,000, and 1,000,000 and is quite close to 100,000. To verify this, let&#39;s determine how many years 100,000 hours is: $$100,000\div24\div365\approx 11$$ How many years is 1,000,000 hours? $$1,000,000\div24\div365\approx 114$$ Which reaffirms that $100,000=10^5$ is the best order-of-magnitude estimate for the age in hours of a 13-year-old student.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The solution is presented in steps.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Step 1: Approximate the number of breaths per minute for a person. Teachers can suggest students measure their own breathing rate. Teachers may also provide data. For an example, we use 12 breaths per minute.</li>
		<li>Step 2: Multiply the number of breaths per minute by 60 to find the number of breaths per hour. So: $$ 12 \frac{\text{breaths}}{\text{minute}} \times 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 720 \frac{\text{breaths}}{\text{hour}} $$</li>
		<li>Step 3: Multiply by 24 to convert breaths per hour to breaths per day: $$ 720 \frac{\text{breaths}}{\text{hour}} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 17,280 \frac{\text{breaths}}{\text{day}} $$</li>
		<li>Step 4: Multiply by 365 to convert breaths per day to breaths per year. So: $$ 17,280 \frac{\text{breaths}}{\text{day}} \times 365 \text{ days} = 6,307,200 \frac{\text{breaths}}{\text{year}} $$</li>
		<li>Step 5: Determine the order of magnitude. According to our example, the order of magnitude is $10^7$. Again, students should explore why 10$^6$ or 10$^{8}$ are not reasonable estimates. Working backwards, 10$^6$ corresponds to about 2 breaths per minute, which is well below a healthy range, whereas 10$^{8}$ yields a breathing rate of about 190 breaths per minute, which is well above a healthy range.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Students can use the fact that there is a direct correlation between breaths and heart rate. Once this relationship is determined, they can use the calculations from part b to determine the solution. For instance, a healthy human heart beats approximately 6 times per breath. Students can multiply the number of breaths per year and the number of heartbeats per breath to find the number of heartbeats per year. For our example: $$ 6,307,200 \frac{\text{breaths}}{\text{year}} \times 6 \frac{\text{heartbeats}}{\text{breath}} = 37,843,200 \frac{\text{heartbeats}}{\text{year}} $$ Finally, to determine the number of heart beats per lifetime, they can multiply by the number of years in a lifetime. For our example, we place the lifespan at 80 years: $$ 37,843,200 \frac{\text{heartbeats}}{\text{year}} \times 80 \text{ years} = 3,027,456,000 \frac{\text{heartbeats}}{\text{lifetime}} $$ This is between $10^9$ and $10^{10}$, but is closer to $10^9$.&nbsp; Again, students should explore why 10$^8$ or 10$^{10}$ are not reasonable estimates. Working backwards, 10$^8$ corresponds to about 2.4 heartbeats per minute (well below a healthy range), whereas 10$^{10}$ corresponds to about 240 heartbeats per minute (well above a healthy range).</li>
	<li>
	<p>We need to use a measurement system that allows us to easily compare the size of a basketball to the size of a room. In this case, we will measure both the room and the basketball in terms of feet. First let us consider the size of a basketball. We can determine the circumference by simply using a tape measure. We can then use the circumference formula to find the diameter. We should find that the diameter of a standard basketball is approximately 9 in, or 0.75 feet. We can estimate that a basketball will fit into a cube that measures 0.75 feet $\times$ 0.75 feet $\times$ 0.75 feet. First, assume that the basketball almost fills the cube, as if we were stacking the balls directly on top of each other in a rectangular array. The basketball fits into a cube with volume of about $0.75^3\text{ ft}^3$, or $0.421875 \text{ ft}^3$.</p>

	<p>Now, let&rsquo;s consider the size of a classroom. Students can use whatever is at their disposal to measure their own classroom, such as yardsticks or measuring tape. As an example, we will use a room that measures 20 feet by 20 feet by 10 feet, since this is a reasonable estimate of an average classroom. This example gives us a classroom with a volume of $4000\text{ ft}^3$ (using the volume formula mentioned above). To compute about how many basketballs fit in the room, we will divide the volume of the room by the volume of the cube that contains the basketballs: $$ 4000 \text{ ft}^3 \div {0.75}^3\text{ ft}^3 \approx 9481 $$ so about 9500 basketballs will fit in the room.</p>

	<p>So as an order of magnitude estimate, we find that we can fit about 10,000 basketballs in the room. We might ask ourselves what would happen if we packed the basketballs more snugly together. We could imagine that there is no gap between the balls and divide by the actual volume of a basketball with a diameter of $\frac34$ feet. The radius is half of that, or $\frac38$, and the volume is $$\frac43 \pi \frac38^3\approx 0.22$$ Again, the volume of the room is 4,000 cubic feet, so we can divide to find the number of basketballs: $$ 4000 \text{ ft}^3 \div 0.22\text{ ft}^3 \approx 18,108 $$ So with this estimate, about 18,000 basketballs will fit in the room. This still seems closer to 10,000 than 100,000.</p>

	<p>Let&#39;s check: How much space would $10^3$ basketballs take up? Imagine they are loosely packed (and so taking up a lot of space); each one takes up the space of a containing cube which has a volume of about $0.42$ cubic feet. The total volume would be about 420 cubic feet. Even if the ceiling in the classroom is only 8 feet tall, that would leave only 52.5 square feet for the area, which would be a very tiny classroom--a square with 7 foot sides, for example.</p>

	<p>How about $10^5$ basketballs? Imagine $10^5$ tightly packed without any gaps between them, so each one takes up the space of a containing cube which has a volume of about $0.22$ cubic feet. The total volume would be about 22,000 cubic feet. If the ceiling in the classroom is only 10 feet tall, the area of the classroom would be 2200 square feet, which is more like the size of a gym. It is possible to have a classroom that large, but not likely, and any real packing of the basketballs would take up more space anyway.</p>

<ol>
	<li>A computer has 128 gigabytes of memory. One gigabyte is $1 \times 10^9$ bytes. A floppy disk, used for storage by computers in the 1970&#39;s, holds about 80 kilobytes. There are 1000 bytes in a kilobyte. How many kilobytes of memory does a modern computer have? How many gigabytes of memory does a floppy disk have? Express your answers both as decimals and using scientific notation.</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>If one gigabyte is $1 \times 10^9$ bytes then 128 gigabytes is $128 \times 10^9$ bytes. Rewriting this number in appropriate scientific notation we find</p>

	<div>$$ \begin{align} 128 \times 10^9 &amp;= 1.28 \times 100 \times 10^9 \\ &amp;= 1.28 \times 10^{11} \end{align} $$ for the computer storage. Since there are 1000 bytes in a kilobyte we can find the number of kilobytes in the computer memory by dividing the number of bytes by 1000 or $1 \times 10^3$. So the computer has $1.28 \times 10^{8}$ kilobytes of memory. This is 128,000,000 or 128 million kilobytes.
	<p>The floppy disk has 80 kilobytes of storage and there are 1000 bytes in a kilobyte so this is 80,000 or $8 \times 10^4$ bytes of storage. There are $1 \times 10^9$ bytes in a gigabyte so the floppy disk storage is $$\frac{8 \times 10^4 \text{ bytes}}{1 \times 10^9 \text{ bytes per gigabyte}}.$$ This is $8 \times 10^{4-9} = 8 \times 10^{-5}$ gigabytes. There are 0.00008 gigabytes of storage on a floppy disk.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>We have $$\begin{align}21,000 &amp;= 2.1 \times 10,000 \\ &amp;= 2.1 \times 10^4 \end{align}$$so it took George $2.1 \times 10^4$ seconds to do his homework. This is not very helpful for giving an intuition of how long George worked on the homework. A more appropriate unit would probably be hours. To check, there are 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute so there are 60 $\times$ 60 = 3600 seconds per hour. This means that George worked on the homework for 21,000 $\div$ 3600 hours. This is a little less than 6 hours.</div>
	</li>
	<li>For a swimming pool, cubic meters or yards would be an appropriate unit. In metric units, there are 100 centimeters in a meter and so $100^3 = 1 \times 10^6$ cubic centimeters in a cubic meter. One teaspoon of water takes up about 4.9 cubic centimeters of space so $3 \times 10^7$ teaspoons would take up about $3 \times 4.9 \times 10^7$ cubic centimeters (or about $1.5 \times 10^8$ cubic centimeters). So, converting from cubic centimeters to cubic meters, our water takes up about $1.5 \times 10^2$ (or 150) cubic meters of space. This is reasonable as a swimming pool 2 meters deep, 5 meters wide, and 15 meters long would have this volume of water.</li>
	<li>One trillion is 1,000,000,000,000 or, in scientific notation, $1 \times 10^{12}$. So one trillionth is $1 \times 10^{-12}$. One picometer is $1 \times 10^{-12}$ meters and the diameter of a helium atom is about $62 \times 10^{-12}$ or $6.2 \times 10^{-11}$ meters. The diameter of the sun is about 1,400,000 km and there are 1000 meters in a kilometer. So the diameter of the sun is about 1,400,000,000 meters or $1.4 \times 10^{9}$ meters. To compare these two diameters, we compute the quotient $1.4 \times 10^9 \div 6.2 \times 10^{-11} \approx&nbsp;0.23 \times 10^{20}$ or, writing this in proper scientific notation, $2.3 \times 10^{19}$. The diameter of the sun is more than &nbsp;$1 \times 10^{19}$ as large as a helium atom, a fantastically large number!</li>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Adding a scale to the graph </span></p>

<p>Students who prefer to work with specific numbers can approach this problem by sketching in a scale on the x-axis and y-axis. For example, if they decided that a pound of peaches might cost a dollar, then they might plot the point (1,1) on the line labeled &quot;Peaches&quot;, then fill out the rest of the scale accordingly. They could then read off the cost of a pound of plums and see that it is less than for peaches.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the second question, they could choose any price per pound $b$ for bananas that is less than the one they read off for plums, and then draw a line from the origin through the point ($b$, 1), and label it &quot;Bananas&quot;.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Slope as Unit Rate </span></p>

<p>The graph that represents the cost of $x$ pounds of peaches is steeper, so it must have a larger slope. The slope can be interpreted as the unit rate; in this case it tells you the cost of a single pound of fruit.<br />
<br />
Since the slope for the peach graph is greater than the slope of the plum graph, the cost of a pound of peaches is greater than the cost of a pound of plums.<br />
<br />
For b, students should realize that the cost per pound of bananas will be represented by a slope that is less than either of the other two, and draw a line through the origin labeled &quot;Bananas&quot; and lying below both of the other graphs.</p>

<p>The slope between two points is calculated by finding the change in $y$-values and dividing by the change in $x$-values. For example, the slope between the points (7, -15) and (-8, 22) can be computed as follows:</p>

<p>Eva, Carl, and Maria are computing the slope between pairs of points on the line shown below.</p>

<p>Eva finds the slope between the points (0,0) and (3,2). Carl finds the slope between the points (3,2) and (6,4). Maria finds the slope between the points (3,2) and (9,6). They have each drawn a triangle to help with their calculations (shown below).</p>

<ul>
	<li>The difference in the $y$-values is $-15-22 = -37$.</li>
	<li>The difference in the $x$-values is $7-(-8) = 15$.</li>
	<li>Dividing these two differences, we find that the slope is $-\frac{37}{15}$.

	<li>
	<p>Eva is using the green triangle, since two of the vertices of the triangle are at $(0,0)$ and $(3,2)$. She will next find the length of each leg in the right triangle. The horizontal leg length is the difference between the $x$-coordinates, which is 3. The vertical leg length is the difference between the $y$-coordinates, which is 2. So the line rises by 2 units for every horizontal increase of 3 units. Therefore the slope is $\frac{2}{3}$.</p>

	<p>Carl is using the blue triangle, since two of the vertices of the triangle are at $(3,2)$ and $(6,4)$. He will next find the length of each leg in the right triangle. The horizontal leg length is the difference between the $x$-coordinates, which is 3. The vertical leg length is the difference between the $y$-coordinates, which is 2. So the line rises by 2 units for every horizontal increase of 3 units. Therefore the slope is $\frac{2}{3}$.</p>

	<p>Maria is using the red triangle, since two of the vertices of the triangle are at $(3,2)$ and $(9,6)$. She will next find the length of each leg in the right triangle. The horizontal leg length is the difference between the $x$-coordinates, which is 6. The vertical leg length is the difference between the $y$-coordinates, which is 4. So the line rises by 4 units for every horizontal increase of 6 units. Therefore, the slope is $\frac{4}{6}$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To compute the slope between two points, we are computing the quotient of the lengths of the legs in a right triangle. We can see that the blue and the green triangles are congruent since we can translate the green triangle along the line until it lines up with the blue triangle. Therefore, the quotient of the lengths of the legs must be the same.</p>

	<p>The red triangle is not congruent to the blue triangle but it is similar to it. We can dilate the blue triangle by a factor of 2 to line it up with the red triangle. The sides in similar triangles also have the same proportion. Therefore, the quotient of the lengths of the legs of the two triangles must be the same.</p>

	<p>The lengths of the vertical leg of this triangle is $y_2-y_1,$ and the length of the horizontal leg is $x_2-x_1$.</p>

	<p>The slope between these two points is the quotient of these two lengths: $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.</p>

	<p>This slope should be the same as the slope obtained by Eva because her green triangle is similar to the triangle we drew above. To see this,</p>

	<ul>
		<li>First, translate Eva&#39;s triangle $x_1$ units to the right and $y_1$ units up. Now the two triangles share a vertex.</li>
		<li>Next, dilate Eva&#39;s triangle by a factor of $\frac13$ (so the horizontal leg has a length of 1) and then by a factor of $x_2-x_1$ (so the horizontal leg has a length of $x_2-x_1$). Use the common vertex as the center of the dilation.</li>
	</ul>
	Because angles are preserved by translations and dilations, this shows that Eva&#39;s triangle and our triangle are similar and that the legs are proportional. So $$\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac23$$ and the slope is the same no matter which two points on this line we choose to compute with.</li>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>$5z + 7 = 3$ has a negative solution. This is because we are adding 7 to the number $5z$, and get a result of 3. The only way for that to happen is to have started with a negative number. So $5z$ must be negative, and since 5 is positive, that is only true when $z$ is negative.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>$7 &minus; 5w = 3$ has a positive solution. We know this because we are starting with 7, a positive number, and we are ending at 3, which is a smaller number. To get there we are subtracting $5w$, which must also be positive in order for us to get from 7 to 3. Since $5w$ is positive, it follows that $w$ must be positive.</p>

	<li>
	<p>If $7-5w =3$, then $w$ must be positive. We are subtracting $5w$ from $7$ and getting something smaller than $7$. So what we are subtracting must be positive. If $5w$ is positive, then $w$ is positive.</p>

	<li>
	<p>If $4a=9a$ then $a=0$. If $a=1$, then the equation is saying $4=9$, so $1$ is not a solution. If $a=2$, then the equation is saying $8=18$, so $2$ is not a solution. If $a=1/2$, then the equation is saying $2=4.5$, so $1/2$ is not a solution. If $a=-3$, then the equation is saying $-12=-27$, so $-3$ is not a solution.

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ivan&rsquo;s furnace has quit working during the coldest part of the year, and he is eager to get it fixed. He decides to call some mechanics and furnace specialists to see what it might cost him to have the furnace fixed. Since he is unsure of the parts he needs, he decides to compare the costs based only on service fees and labor costs. Shown below are the price estimates for labor that were given to him by three different companies. Each company has given the same time estimate for fixing the furnace.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Company A charges \$35 per hour to its customers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Company B charges a \$20 service fee for coming out to the house and then \$25 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Company C charges a \$45 service fee for coming out to the house and then \$20 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For which time intervals should Ivan choose Company A, Company B, Company C? Support your decision with sound reasoning and representations. Consider including equations, tables, and graphs.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes to fix the furnace, and $y$ the cost in dollars of fixing the furnace. Company A&#39;s cost can be modeled with the equation $$y = 35x,$$ company B&#39;s with the equation $$y = 25x+20,$$ and company C&#39;s with the equation $$y = 20x + 45.$$</p>

<p>Graphing the equations helps students visualize the solution.</p>

<p><img alt=""Sol_1_9a6852ee2b000b047b6e7be40738353f"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/249/max/Sol_1_9a6852ee2b000b047b6e7be40738353f.jpg?1327793683"" /></p>

<p>Looking at the graph, it appears that the graph that represents the cost for company A is below the other two graphs for any amount of time less that 2 hours, where the graph intersects the line that represents the cost of company B. The graph for company B is below the other two up until 5 hours, where it intersects the graph that represents the cost for company C. In other words, company A is least expensive for 0 to 2 hours, company B is least expensive for 2 to 5 hours, and company C is least expensive for more than five hours.</p>

<p>Students should get in the habit of checking the coordinates of the intersection points algebraically, since it is often the case that the coordinates of the intersection points are not whole numbers (and therefore not easy to read from the graph). This also reinforces the relationship between the algebraic representation of the solution and the graphical representation of the solution.</p>

<p>To find the solution algebraically, consider each pair of equations as a system. Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes to repair the furnace and $y$ be the cost of the repair (without parts).</p>

<p>To find the number of hours for which company A and company B cost the same, consider $y = 35x$ and $y = 25x + 20.$ Substituting for $y$, we get $$35x = 25x + 20.$$ The solution to this equation gives the number of hours for which company A and company B cost the same. Solving this equation, we find that the cost of company A and company B is the same for 2 hours of labor. The cost is \$70.</p>

<p>To find the number of hours for which company A and company C cost the same, &nbsp;consider $y = 35x$ and $y = 20x + 45.$ Substituting for $y$, we get $$35x = 20x + 45.$$ Solving this equation, we find that the cost of company A and company C is the same for 3 hours labor, for a total cost of \$105.</p>

<p>To find the number of hours for which company B and company C cost the same, consider $y = 25x+20$ and $y = 20x + 45.$ Substituting for $y$, we get $$25x + 20 = 20x + 45.$$ Solving this equation, we find that the cost of company B and company C is the same for 5 hours labor, for a total cost of \$145.</p>

<p>Some additional substitution of values shows that company C is \$15 more expensive than A and B at 2 hours. Company B is \$10 less than A and C at 3 hours. And company A is \$30 more expensive at 5 hours than companies B and C.</p>

<p>As before, we found that company A is the least expensive up to a time of 2 hours, at which point company A and B are the same cost. From 2 hours to 5 hours, company B is the least expensive, and at 5 hours company B and C both cost \$145. For more than 5 hours, Company C will be the least expensive.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s define a function which assigns to an input $t$ (a year between 2002 and 2010) the total amount of garbage, $G$, produced in that year (in million tons). To find these values, you can look them up in the table.</p>

<ol>
	<li>How much garbage was produced in 2004?</li>
	<li>In which year did the US produce 251 million tons of garbage?</li>
	<li>Does the table describe a linear function?</li>
	<li>Draw a graph that shows this data.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Finding $t = 2004$ in our table, we see that 249 million tons of garbage was produced in 2004.</li>
	<li>Finding $G = 251$ in our table, we see that the US produced 251 million tons of garbage in two years that are listed in the table, 2006 and 2008.</li>
	<li>For this function to be linear equal changes in input values have to correspond to equal changes in output values. Since our input values, $t$, are given for every year, we would want our output values, $G$, to be increasing by the same amount for each year. We can see that from 2002 to 2003, $G$ changed from 239 to 242 million tons, so it increased by 3 million tons. However, from 2003 to 2004, $G$ changed from 242 to 249 million tons, meaning it increased by 7 million tons. From 2005 to 2006 the amount of garbage even decreased by 3 million tons. Therefore, our function is not linear.</li>
	<li>
	<p>By plotting the points given in the table, we arrive at the following graph, which also shows that the function is not linear because the points do not all lie on a line.</p>

","<h1>8.F Battery Charging</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sam wants to take his MP3 player and his video game player on a car trip. An hour before they plan to leave, he realized that he forgot to charge the batteries last night. At that point, he plugged in both devices so they can charge as long as possible before they leave.</p>

<p>Sam knows that his MP3 player has 40% of its battery life left and that the battery charges by an additional 12 percentage points every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>His video game player is new, so Sam doesn&rsquo;t know how fast it is charging but he recorded the battery charge for the first 30 minutes after he plugged it in.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>

			<th>time charging (minutes)</th>

<ol>
	<li>If Sam&rsquo;s family leaves as planned, what percent of the battery will be charged for each of the two devices when they leave?</li>
	<li>How much time would Sam need to charge the battery 100% on both devices?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Finding and using equations </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The battery charge of both devices can be modeled with linear functions. The wording describing the MP3 player suggests a linear function since it uses a constant rate of change. The table of values for the video game player shows a constant rate of change for the first 30 minutes. It is a reasonable assumption that the battery will continue to charge at the same rate. However, it is an assumption on our part. (Another possibility would be that as the battery charge approaches 100%, the rate of change decreases, but that would be much harder to model.)</p>

	<p>The MP3 player charges at a rate of 12 percentage points every 15 minutes, which is equal to 0.8 percentage points per minute. If we let $y$ be battery charge of the device (in percentage points) we have: $$y=0.8 t + 40,$$ where $t$ is measured in minutes.</p>

	<p>We know that the video game player is initially 20% charged and from the table we see that the charge increases by an additional 12 percentage points every 10 minutes, or 1.2 percentage points per minute. So for this function we get: $$y=1.2t+20.$$</p>

	<p>Sam&rsquo;s family is planning to leave the house 60 minutes after Sam started charging his devices. We are looking for the charge when $t=60$:</p>

	<p>MP3 player: $y=0.8 \cdot 60+40=88$ % charged</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>video game player: $y=1.2\cdot60+20=92$ % charged</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To answer this question, we need to find the values of $t$ for which each function has output value 100.</p>

	<p>MP3 player: Solving $100=0.8t+40$ for $t$ we have, $t=75$ minutes.</p>

	<p>video game player: Solving $100=1.2t+20$ for $t$ we have $t=67$ minutes.</p>

	<p>So if Sam&rsquo;s family could wait just 15 more minutes, Sam could have both devices fully charged for the car trip.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Using tables </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>Since the video game player&rsquo;s battery charge is given in a table, we can extend the table and see what value it will give after 60 minutes. Note that the rate of change of the data in the table is constant: For every 10 minutes the charge increases by 12 percentage points. Assuming that this pattern continues, we have:
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>time charging (minutes)</th>
				<td>0</td>
				<td>10</td>
				<td>20</td>
				<td>30</td>
				<td>40</td>
				<td>50</td>
				<td>60</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>video game player battery charge (%)</th>
				<td>20</td>
				<td>32</td>
				<td>44</td>
				<td>56</td>
				<td>68</td>
				<td>80</td>
				<td>92</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>We can make a similar table for the MP3 player:</p>

	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>time charging (minutes)</th>
				<td>0</td>
				<td>15</td>
				<td>30</td>
				<td>45</td>
				<td>60</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>MP3 player battery charge (%)</th>
				<td>40</td>
				<td>52</td>
				<td>64</td>
				<td>76</td>
				<td>88</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>So after 60 minutes, the MP3 player&rsquo;s battery would be 88% charged and the video game player will be 92% charged.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We can see from the table above that the MP3 player would be fully charged in another 15 minutes, we just have to add one more column to the table to find that answer.</p>

	<p>The video game player will need less than 10 minutes to fully charge, since we are only missing 8 percentage points after 60 minutes. To be exact, using the rate of increase, we will need 2/3 of 10 minutes, which is just under 7 minutes.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Using graphs </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>With the given information, it is quite straight-forward to graph the functions for both devices. For the MP3 player we have a starting value (i.e. vertical intercept) of 40% and a rate of change (i.e. slope) of 12/15 = 0.8 percentage points per minute.</p>

	<p>For the video game player we have a starting value of 20% and the rate of change for the data in the table is constant at 12/10 = 1.2 percentage points per minute. Below are the two graphs.</p>

	<p><img alt=""Battery_charge_a_edbfc057dccfbe88e59d1a98e1ffb6f9"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/713/large/battery_charge_a_edbfc057dccfbe88e59d1a98e1ffb6f9.jpg?1333173598"" /></p>

	<p>We can estimate from the graph that after 60 minutes the MP3 player has a battery charge of just under 90% and the video game player has a battery charge of just over 90%. Zooming in on a graphing calculator or other graphing device would give us better estimates.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To find out how long it will take until both batteries are fully charged, we need to find values of $t$ for which the output value is 100% for both functions.</p>

	<p><img alt=""Battery_charge_b_7c802c86caf1dda2431d0ad122e0697e"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/714/large/battery_charge_b_7c802c86caf1dda2431d0ad122e0697e.jpg?1333173623"" /></p>

	<p>From the graph we see that the MP3 player will take the longest to charge and it will take about 75 minutes total. So if Sam&rsquo;s family can wait an extra 15 minutes before they leave, Sam would have both devices fully charged.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>We can find which of the given points are on the line $y = 2x + 1$ by seeing if the $x$ and $y$ coordinate satisfy the equation. For the first point, with $y = 1$ and $x = 0$, we see</p>
	$$ 1 = 2(0) + 1 = 1 $$

	<p>which is true, and so the point $(0,1)$ is on the line. However, for $(2,-1)$, by substituting $x = 2$ and $y = -1$, we have</p>
	$$ -1 \neq 2(2) + 1 = 5 $$

	<p>and so $(2,-1)$ is not on the line.</p>

	<p>Continuing this way, we see that $(0,1), (2,5), (1/2,2)$, and $(-1,-1)$ are points on the line and $(2,-1)$, and $(.5,1)$ are not points on the line.</p>

	<p>We can find three more points by arbitrarily choosing value for $x$ and using the equation for the line to find the corresponding $y$ values: $(-2, -3), (1, 3), (-1/2, 0)$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>By picking arbitrary $x$ values, such as $x=0$, $x=1$, $x=2$, $x=-1$, and $x=-2$, we find the corresponding $y$ values and have several points that lie on the graph of the function:</p>
	$$ (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 9), (-1, 3), (-2, 9) $$

	<p>By plotting these points, we arrive at the following graph:</p>

	<p>A linear function can be written in the form $y=mx+b$, and this is equation is not written in that form. We might wonder whether it could be written in that form using some clever trick we haven&#39;t thought of yet. If it were a linear function, its graph would be a straight line. The graph of $y = 2x^2 + 1$ contains the above five points, and these five points do not lie in a line. Thus, it is not a linear function.</p>

		<li>The first function has negative and positive $y$ values, and the second function will never have negative $y$ values.</li>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This task examines the mathematics behind an origami construction of a rectangle whose sides have the ratio $(\sqrt{2}:1)$. Such a rectangle is called a <em>silver rectangle</em>.</p>

<p>Beginning with a square piece of paper, first fold and unfold it leaving the diagonal crease as shown here:</p>

<p>After unfolding then fold the left hand side of the rectangle over to the crease from the previous fold:</p>

	<li>Show that $\triangle PQT$ is a 45-45-90 isosceles triangle.</li>
	<li>Calculate $|PQ|$ and conclude that $PQRS$ is a silver rectangle.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Since reflection about $\ell$ maps $P$ to itself and maps $S$ to $T$ this means that segments $\overline{PS}$ and $\overline{PT}$ are interchanged by reflection about $\ell$. Hence $$ |PS| = |PT| $$ because reflections preserve lengths of segments. We are given that $|PS| = s$ since it is one side of the square so $|PT| = s$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We know that $m(\angle QPT) = 45$ because the diagonal of a square bisects the 90 degree angles. Alternatively, reflection over the diagonal $\overleftrightarrow{PT}$ is a symmetry of the square: this reflection interchanges angles $QPT$ and $SPT$ and so these must each measure 45 degrees. Angle $TQP$ is a right angle because $\overline{QR}$ is a crease resulting from a horizontal fold of the paper. Since $$ m(\angle QTP) + m(\angle QPT) + m(\angle TQP) = 180 $$ this means that $m(\angle QTP) = 45$. Thus $\triangle PQT$ is a 45-45-90 triangle: it is isosceles because $m(\angle QTP) = m(\angle QPT)$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To find $|PQ|$ we use the fact that $\triangle PQT$ is a right isosceles triangle. Thus we know that $|TQ| = |PQ|$ and, from the Pythagorean Theorem, $$ |PQ|^2 + |TQ|^2 = |PT|^2. $$ Substituting $|PQ|$ for $|TQ|$ this is equivalent to $$ 2|PQ|^2 = |PT|^2. $$ From part (a) this means that $$ |PQ|^2 = \frac{s^2}{2}. $$ So $$ |PQ| = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}. $$</p>

	<p>We can now check that $PQRS$ is a silver rectangle. Our calculations show that $|PS|:|PQ|$ is $s:\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}$. But the ratio $s:\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}$ is equivalent to the ratio $\sqrt{2}:1$ as we can see using a scaling factor of $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{s}$.</p>

	<li>Can the congruence of the two rectangles be shown with a single reflection? Explain.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>We can do this by choosing a vertex of Rectangle 1 and then translate this to a carefully selected vertex of Rectangle 2 and then follow this with a rotation about the chosen vertex of Rectangle 2. Pictured below are two possibilities for the translation:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Isometry2_92ca5d08ee49739fdf1961d91ef0abd7"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/616/max/isometry2_92ca5d08ee49739fdf1961d91ef0abd7.jpg?1350607728"" /></p>

	<p>Below is the impact of translating by the lower left arrow which moves Rectangle 1 six boxes to the left and five boxes up to what is now labelled rectangle $PQRS$.:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Isometry3_bb1293a7e13245ccbd1f4f6694ee2b6f"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/618/max/isometry3_bb1293a7e13245ccbd1f4f6694ee2b6f.jpg?1350688282"" /></p>

	<p>Also labelled in the picture are vertices $O$ and $T$ of Rectangle 2 and the angle measure $a = m(\angle OPS)$. Rotating rectangle $PQRS$ by angle $a$, counterclockwise, will bring ray $\overrightarrow{PS}$ to ray $\overrightarrow{PO}$. Since $\overline{PO}$ is congruent to $\overline{PS}$ this means that the rotation maps $S$ to $O$. We know that $m(\angle SPQ) = 90^\circ$ and $m(\angle OPT) = 90^\circ$. This means that the rotation by $a$ counterclockwise maps ray $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ to $\overrightarrow{PT}$. Since segments $\overline{PQ}$ and $\overline{PT}$ are congruent, this means that $Q$ maps to $T$. The three vertices $O,P,T$ determine Rectangle 2 so this translation followed by a rotation maps Rectangle 1 to Rectangle 2.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A translation can move Rectangle 1 to any other position on the coordinate grid but will not influence the angles its sides make with the grid lines. The lines containing the upper and lower sides of the rectangle will always be parallel to the horizontal lines of the grid while the lines containing the left and right sides of Rectangle 1 will always be parallel to the vertical lines in the grid. Since none of the lines containing sides of Rectangle 2 are parallel to the grid lines, Rectangle 1 cannot be moved to Rectangle 2 with a translation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The congruence cannot be exhibited with a single reflection. To see this, we can choose a vertex of Rectangle 1. This is done in the picture below where the chosen vertex is denoted by $A$:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Isometry4_ebad90878364097499fe047db02ee641"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/619/max/isometry4_ebad90878364097499fe047db02ee641.jpg?1350697026"" /></p>

	<p>A congruence of two rectangles maps vertices to vertices so this means that $A$ would have to map to one of the four vertices of Rectangle 2. Of these four reflections the one which maps Rectangle 1 closest to Rectangle 2 is the one which sends $A$ to $B$. Below is a picture, in red, of the line of reflection which interchanges $A$ and $B$ (the perpendicular bisector of segment $\overline{AB}$) and the image of Rectangle 1 under this reflection, in blue.</p>

	<p><img alt=""Isometry5_74370d84e4bacc1a35311a0cd486fc59"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/620/max/isometry5_74370d84e4bacc1a35311a0cd486fc59.jpg?1350697752"" /></p>

	<p>Note that folding over a line which makes a $45^\circ$ angle with the horizontal and vertical grid lines interchanges the horizontal and vertical lines of the grid.</p>

	<p>Similarly, any reflection that maps vertex $A$ to any of the other four vertices will not work either. So there is no reflection that maps one of the rectangles to the other.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

In high school mathematics the topic of congruence will be developed in a coherent, logical way, giving students the tools to investigate many geometric questions. In Grade 8, the treatment is informal, and students discover what they can about congruence through experimentation with actual motions.</p>

Here instead of the $x$-axis we look at the set of points where $y = 2000$ since this is the line of reflection for the problem. Instead of the usual $y$-axis, we have plotted the set of points where $x = 995$ so that our point $(1000,2012)$ will appear in the picture: any other choice of $x$ value sufficiently close to $1000$ would also work.</p>

<p>Note that the line of reflection $y = 2000$ is the perpendicular bisector of the blue segment. This means that the point $(1000,1988)$ is the reflection of $(1000,2012)$ about the line $y = 2000$.</p>

<p>There are many valid methods to transform the polygon and one of these is described here. This sequence has the advantage that it uses one translations, one rotation, one reflection, and one dilation. The first step is to reflect the polygon, labeled $ABCDEFG,$ over the $y$-axis:</p>

<p>Next we translate $A&#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;C&#39;&#39;D&#39;&#39;E&#39;&#39;F&#39;&#39;G&#39;&#39;$ down 5 units and left 1 unit so that the image of point $A&#39;&#39;$, denoted $A&#39;&#39;&#39;$, is the point $(1, 1)$. This is shown below:</p>

<p>Lastly we dilate $A&#39;&#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;&#39;C&#39;&#39;&#39;D&#39;&#39;&#39;E&#39;&#39;&#39;F&#39;&#39;&#39;G&#39;&#39;&#39;$ about $(1,1)$ with a scale factor of $2$. The center $A&#39;&#39;&#39;$ does not move when we apply this dilation. For the other vertices, we take $B&#39;&#39;&#39;$ as an example. The image of $B&#39;&#39;&#39;$ will be on $\overleftrightarrow{A&#39;&#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;&#39;}$ but its distance from $A&#39;&#39;&#39;$ is twice that of $B&#39;&#39;&#39;$. Since $B&#39;&#39;&#39;$ lies on the vertical line $y=1$ and it is two units down from $(1,1)$, its image, $B&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;$, will also lie on $y = 1$ but it will be $2 \times 2$ or $4$ units down from $(1,1)$. This means that $B&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; = (1,-3)$. All other vertices can be placed in a similar manner, with the result pictured below:</p>

","<h1>8.G Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Pythagorean triple $(a,b,c)$ is a set of three positive whole numbers which satisfy the equation $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2. $$ Many ancient cultures used simple Pythagorean triples such as (3,4,5) in order to accurately construct right angles: if a triangle has sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5 units, respectively, then the angle opposite the side of length 5 units is a right angle.</p>

<ol>
	<li>State the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse.</li>
	<li>Explain why this practice of constructing a triangle with side-lengths 3, 4, and 5 to produce a right angle uses the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem.</li>
	<li>Explain, in this particular case, why the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem is true.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle with side lengths $a,b,c$, with $c$ being the length of the hypotenuse (that is, the side opposite the right angle), the relationship $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$ always holds.</p>

	<p>The converse of the Pythagorean Theorem says that <em> if </em> $a,b,c$ are side lengths of a triangle that satisfy $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$ then the angle opposite the side of length $c$ is a right angle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The ancient cultures are trying to conclude that an angle is a right angle based on the side lengths of a triangle. Looking at part (a), it is the <em> converse </em> of the Pythagorean Theorem which has as its conclusion that an angle is a right angle so they are using the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem. Since $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$, the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem implies that a triangle with side lengths $3,4,5$ is a right triangle, the right angle being opposite the side of length $5$.</p>

	<p>To put this in other words, the Pythagorean Theorem tells us that a certain relation holds amongst the side lengths of a right triangle. The architects, however, do not have a right triangle but rather want to <em> produce </em> a right triangle. The converse of the Pythagorean Theorem enables them to do just this: they can conclude that an angle is a right angle provided a certain relationship holds between side lengths of a triangle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Suppose $AB$ is a line segment of length $4$ units. The set of points in the plane whose distance from $A$ is $3$ units forms a circle $C$. If $P$ is a point on $C$ then the length $\left|BP\right|$ could be as small as $1$, if $P$ is on segment $AB$, and as large as $7$ if $P$ is opposite $B$ on line $AB$.</p>

	<p><img alt=""345_triangle_4e060377a36229e8912c934f7eca625e"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/348/medium/345_Triangle_4e060377a36229e8912c934f7eca625e.jpg?1344971461"" /></p>

	<p>If we imagine the point $P$ moving around the circle in either direction, the length of $BP$ increases from 1 to 7 as $P$ moves away from $B$. On the way, there are exactly two places where $\angle PAB$ will be a right angle, namely when $P$ is the northernmost point of $C$ or when $P$ is the southernmost point of $C$. In both cases, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to compute the length of $\left|BP\right|$ and find that it is 5 units. Note that if $P$ is on the right side of the circle, its length will be less than when it is exactly vertical, and if it is on the left side of the circle, its length will be greater than when it is exactly vertical. So there are only two triangles that we can construct with side lengths 3, 4, and 5, and they happen only when the angle opposite the side with length 5 is a right angle. So if a triangle has side lengths 3, 4, and 5 units, it must be a right triangle.</p>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and two right triangles by drawing perpendiculars from $A$ and $B$ to the base $\overline{DC}$ as in the picture below:</p>

<p><img alt=""Solution_picture_ecd466eded7c3d10d1dce6d62e1cbe57"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/984/max/Solution_Picture_ecd466eded7c3d10d1dce6d62e1cbe57.jpg?1360549052"" /></p>

<p>To see that $ABFE$ is a rectangle, note that since $ABC$ is a trapezoid, this means that $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{CD}$ are parallel. Since $\overleftrightarrow{AE}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{BF}$ are perpendicular to $\overleftrightarrow{DC}$ they are also perpendicular to $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$. In particular, angles $EAB$ and $FBA$ are right angles and quadrilateral $ABFE$ is a rectangle.</p>

<p>We can now find the area of $ABCD$ by calculating the areas of $\triangle DAE$, $\triangle CBF$, and rectangle $ABFE$. Segements $\overline{AE}$ and $\overline{BF}$ are both altitudes for rectangle $ABCD$ and so are congruent to the segment of length 12 units given in the picture. Since angle $AED$ is a right angle we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find $$ |DE|^2 + |AE|^2 = |AD|^2 $$ Plugging in $|AD| = 15$ and $|AE| = 12$ we find that $|DE|^2 = 225 - 144 = 81$. So $|DE| = 9$. so $|DE|=9$. Since angle $BFC$ is a angle we may apply the Pythagorean theorem to find $$ |FC|^2 + |BF|^2 = |BC|^2. $$ Plugging in $|BC| = 20$ and $|BF| = 12$ we find $|FC|^2 = 400 -144 = 256$ so $|FC| = 16$.</p>

<p>Putting this information together, the area of $\triangle DAE$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 12 = 54$. The area of $\triangle CBF$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 12 = 96$. Finally, rectangle $ABCD$ is 50 by 12 so it has area 600. Adding these three quantities gives $$ \text{Area}(ABCD) = 54 + 96 + 600 = 750. $$</p>

<p>Alternatively, if students know the formula for the area of a trapezoid, namely one half the height times the sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides, we have that that the height is 12. The two parallel sides have lengths 50 and 50 + 16 + 9 or 75. So applying the formula gives $$ \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times (50 + 75) = 750. $$</p>

	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>We can see that Jessica&#39;s triangle is isosceles in several ways. We will show that $|AC| = |BC|$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to check that these both have length $\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2}$. In the calculations below $M = (3,1)$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div>\begin{align} |AC|^2 &amp;= |AM|^2 + |MC|^2 = 2^2 + 3^2\\ |BC|^2 &amp;= |BM|^2 + |MC|^2 = 2^2 + 3^2. \end{align}</div>

	<p>We can also observe that to get from $A$ to $C$ we go over (to the right) by two units and then up three units. To get from $B$ to $C$ we go over (to the left) by two units and then up three units. We travel the same distance to get from $A$ or $B$ to $C$ so $A$ and $B$ are equidistant from $C$. Finally, we can draw the horizontal line of symmetry for $\triangle ABC$:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Isos5_32f159f444d47a672b87c885e1af049e"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/429/large/isos5_32f159f444d47a672b87c885e1af049e.jpg?1371671071"" /></p>

	<p>Isosceles triangles are exactly those triangles with a line of symmetry so $\triangle ABC$ must be isosceles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The same three methods that applied to Jessica&#39;s triangle also apply to Bruce&#39;s triangle. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to check that $\overline{DF}$ and $\overline{DE}$ both have length $\sqrt{4^2+1^2}$. In the calculations below $G = (5,1)$ and $H = (1,5)$: these points are labelled in the next picture which also shows the line of symmetry of Bruce&#39;s triangle.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div>\begin{align} |DF|^2 &amp;= |DH|^2 + |HF|^2 = 4^2 + 1^2\\ |DE|^2 &amp;= |DG|^2 + |GE|^2 = 4^2 + 1^2. \end{align}</div>

	<p>We can also observe that to get from $D$ to $F$ we go over (to the right) by one unit and then up four units. To get from $D$ to $E$ we go over (to the right) by four units and then up one unit. We travel the same distance to get from $D$ to $F$ or $E$ so $F$ and $E$ are equidistant from $D$. Finally, we can draw the line of symmetry for $\triangle DEF$:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Isos7_052f70f690b108a204e283c346b5a233"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/431/large/isos7_052f70f690b108a204e283c346b5a233.jpg?1371672575"" /></p>

	<p>To check that this is a line of symmetry, note that it is perpendicular to $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ which we can see since it is one diagonal of the coordinate square where it meets $\overline{EF}$ with $\overline{EF}$ being the other diagonal. Also the lines meet at the midpoint of $\overline{EF}$, in the center of the coordinate square.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Yan&#39;s triangle is different from Jessica&#39;s and Bruce&#39;s triangles. If we count the number of boxes to get from one vertex to another (horizontally and vertically), we get different pairs of numbers for each pair of vertices. Also, the triangle does have a line of symmetry but it is not easy to identify this line from the picture. It is actually not even easy to distinguish which two sides have the same length.</p>

	<p>So the best method for checking the side lengths of Yan&#39;s triangle is to use the Pythagorean Theorem. The coordinates for the three vertices are $P = (-4,2), Q = (2,-5), R = (5,4)$. With this information and the Pythagorean Theorem we can calculate the three side lengths:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div>\begin{align} |PQ|^2 &amp;= 6^2 + 7^2 = 85 \\ |PR|^2 &amp;= 9^2 +2^2 = 85 \\ |QR^2| &amp;= 3^2 + 9^2 = 90. \end{align}</div>

	<p>We can see that $|PQ| = |PR|$ and both are a little smaller than $|QR|$ but this difference is small enough that it is difficult to see in the picture. Since $|PQ| = |PR|$ we have shown that $\triangle PQR$ is isosceles.</p>

<p>In Grade 6, students calculate distances in the coordinate plane between points lying on the same horizontal or vertical line. In particular, they calculate the lengths of the vertical and horizontal legs of a triangle corresponding to two points in the coordinate plane. In Grade 7, they can use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the length of its hypotenuse, which is the distance between the two points. Calculating this distance as an application of the Pythagorean Theorem before doing so in high school as an application of the distance formula provides students an opportunity to look for and make use of structure in the coordinate plane (MP.7), and provides an opportunity for students to connect the distance formula to previous learning.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>You should purchase the cylinder vase. If $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height, then, using the fact that the radius is half the diameter, we get</p>

	<p>\begin{align} \mbox{Cylinder Volume} &amp;= \pi r^2 h\\ &amp; = \pi(5)^2(40) \text{ cm}^3\\ &amp;= 1000 \pi \text{ cm}^3. \end{align}</p>

	<p>\begin{align} \mbox{Cone Volume} &amp;= \frac13 \pi r^2 h\\ &amp;= \frac13 \pi(8)^2(45) \text{ cm}^3\\ &amp;= 960 \pi \text{ cm}^3. \end{align}</p>

	<p>\begin{align} \mbox{Sphere Volume} &amp;= \frac43 \pi r^3\\ &amp;= \frac43 \pi (9)^3 \text{ cm}^3\\ &amp;= 972 \pi \text{ cm}^3. \end{align}</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>$\text{Cylinder Volume} - \text{Cone Volume} = 1000 \pi \text{ cm}^3 - 960 \pi \text{ cm}^3 = 40 \pi \text{ cm}^3$</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the diameter decreases by 2 cm, then the radius decreases by 1 cm. Now the cone holds more water:</p>
	\begin{align} \mbox{Cylinder Volume} &amp;= \pi r^2 h\\ &amp;= \pi(4)^2(40) \text{ cm}^3\\ &amp;= 640 \pi \text{ cm}^3. \end{align}

	<p>\begin{align} \mbox{Cone Volume}&amp;= \frac13 \pi r^2 h\\ &amp;= \frac13 \pi(7)^2(45) \text{ cm}^3\\ &amp;= 735 \pi \text{ cm}^3. \end{align}</p>

	<p>\begin{align} \mbox{Sphere volume} &amp;= \frac43 \pi r^3\\ &amp;= \frac43 \pi (8)^3 \text{ cm}^3\\ &amp;= 682 \frac23 \pi \text{ cm}^3. \end{align}</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The total volume is the volume of the cylinder plus the volume of the cone. If the cylinder has height $x$ cm then the cone has height $42-x$ cm, since the total height is 42 cm. So the volume of the cylinder plus the volume of the cone is</p>
	\begin{align} \pi r^2 x + \frac13 \pi r^2 (42-x) &amp;= \pi(6)^2(x)+\frac13 \pi(6)^2(42-x) \\ &amp;= 36\pi x + 12\pi(42-x) \\ &amp;= 36\pi x + 504 \pi - 12\pi x\\ &amp;= 24 \pi x + 504 \pi. \end{align} So to find $x$ we must solve the equation \begin{align} 1224 \pi &amp;= 24 \pi x + 504 \pi\\ 720\pi &amp;= 24 \pi x \\ x &amp;= 30 \text{ cm} \end{align}</li>

	<li>Since $$0.33\overline{3} = \frac13$$ $0.33\overline{3}$ is a rational number.</li>

	<p>Since $$1.414213 = \frac{1414213}{100000},$$ $1.414213$ is a rational number.</p>

	<p>$\pi = 3.141592&hellip;$ is not rational. In eighth grade most students know that $\pi$ is irrational as a &quot;fact.&quot; The proof of this is quite sophisticated.</p>

	<p>$\frac17=0.\overline{142857}$ is already written in a way that makes it clear it is a rational number, although some students might say it is irrational, possibly because the repeating part of the decimal is longer than many familiar repeating decimals (like $\frac13$).</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>The two variables are time, $t$ and battery charge, $b$. There are several ways we can choose the units. A reasonable choice is &quot;time in minutes since the laptop was plugged in&quot; and &quot;battery charge in percentage of full, %&quot;</li>
	<li>
	<p>The laptop started charging at 9:11 a.m. and it was initially 41% charged. If we let $t$ be time since the laptop was plugged in, this information corresponds to the point with coordinates $(0,41).$ Similarly, we can translate the information in the other screenshots into coordinate points: $(16, 56),\ (25, 64),\ (37, 74),\ (44, 79),\ (57, 86),\ (66, 91)$.</p>

	<p><img alt=""Scatter_plot_8d10bf16afb894892979b0d36ea3a834"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/514/large/scatter_plot_8d10bf16afb894892979b0d36ea3a834.jpg?1372268876"" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There are several different ways we can draw a line that &quot;fits&quot; the data. The goal is to find a line that does a reasonable job of approximating the pattern in the scatter plot. This means that it may not hit any points exactly, but it minimizes the distance between the line and the data points over all. There is a specific mathematical method that finds the line of best fit that students will see in grade 9. But for the purpose of this task, using an uncooked spaghetti or a ruler is appropriate.</p>

	<p><img alt=""Line_only_898c41c1c358806075bda2d704fac93e"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/516/large/line_only_898c41c1c358806075bda2d704fac93e.jpg?1372269064"" /></p>

	<p>After drawing the line we can find its slope and read off the vertical intercept. For the line shown above (individual students may have different lines), it looks like the data point $(16,56)$ lies on the line and we can estimate a second point on the line, for example $(57,87)$. So the slope of the line is $\displaystyle{\frac{(87-56)}{(57-16)}=\frac{31}{41}\approx0.76}$. The vertical intercept is close to 43. Therefore, the equation of the line is $b=0.76t+43.$</p>

	<p>Note that we estimated the coordinates of the points on the line that we used to find the equation. Depending on how carefully the line is drawn and the coordinates are estimated, the equations students come up with may differ.</p>

	<p>It is also worth noting that the vertical intercept of the line is slightly higher than the actual battery charge when the computer was plugged in.

<p>After a few moments the teacher taps a student on the head and sits in the student&#39;s spot. The student then gets up from the circle and continues the counting at the point that the teacher left off while walking around the outside of the circle.</p>

<p>At the teacher&rsquo;s signal the student who is counting selects the nearest student to them by tapping them on the head to take over counting and sits in that student&rsquo;s spot. The next child then continues the counting sequence until the teacher indicates a change and so on until each child has had a turn.

<p>&ldquo;I know that nine is greater than six because my brother is nine years old and I&#39;m six years old, and&nbsp;he&rsquo;s older than me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, you have six. One more is seven. One more is eight. One more is nine. So nine is greater than six. Okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when I see the number line I see six comes before nine.&rdquo; &ldquo;</p>

<p>This many fingers is six (shows six fingers). This many fingers is nine (shows nine fingers). I have to put up more to show you nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any answer which includes the child correctly explaining why one number is greater or less than the other is acceptable. The teacher should encourage students to use the words greater than/less than. The first few times this activity is done the answers may be long and full of extra information that is not relevant to the problem such as, &ldquo;You know my brother Jayovanni. He&rsquo;s in third grade. He used to be in kindergarten with you Mrs. Wood. He loved kindergarten! Well now he&rsquo;s in Ms. Martin&rsquo;s class. My mama got him new blue Jordans, but I didn&#39;t get new ones because my feet are still the same size as when I got these shoes. Well Jayovonni is nine. And I&rsquo;m five. Five is less then six. Jayovonni is older then me. I know that nine is more then six because Jayovonni is nine and he is older then me.&rdquo; If this happens the teacher should paraphrase the relevant math information back to the student.</p>

<p>The answer of &ldquo;nine is bigger than six&rdquo; is not a sufficient answer. The students need to explain why they know nine is greater than six, or six is less than nine.

<p>(Whole-class version) The teacher secretly places between 1 and 10 marbles in a paper bag, then shows the bag to the class. After shaking it enough times for students to hear the marbles inside, and 4 or 5 students guess how many marbles are in the bag. The teacher writes the guesses on the board. Afterwards the contents of the bag are revealed and counted out. The teacher writes the number representing the total on the board, and the students then help sort their guesses into less than, greater than, or equal to the number of marbles in the bag. The game repeats until everyone has had a chance to guess at least once.</p>

<p>(Small group version) This works like the class version but one student in a group fill the bag with marbles themselves and the rest of the group tries to guess the number.

At first, side length is the only component considered. Later experience brings an intuitive appreciation of angle size. Students combine two-dimensional shapes and solve problems such as deciding which piece will fit into a space in a puzzle, intuitively using geometric motions (slides, flips, and turns, the informal names for translations, reflections, and rotations, respectively).

<p>Action</p>

<p>Students will be given double sided counters/dots (see picture of counters, above). It is important for the markers to match the colors on the counters. Students take five counters in their cupped hands (or a cup), shake them around, pour them onto the desk. Next, they count how many counters are yellow and how many are red. Students then record the numbers in their book and write a corresponding equation. For example, if the counters landed so that 1 was yellow and 4 were red, then the student would draw one yellow dot and four red dots and then write &ldquo;1+4=5&rdquo; under the drawing. The student would then collect the counters and roll them again. For each combination of colors, the students record with a picture and an equation. Students continue until they fill their book of 5. The teacher can choose how many pages to put in, somewhere between five and eight is a good number so that students get a chance to see multiple combinations. After the students have completed their books, the teacher should have a whole-group discussion to make the number relationships explicit. One way to do this is to write each of the two addends into a table and to discuss possible patterns and reasons for the pattern. The teacher can ask specific questions such as, &ldquo;What do you notice about the numbers in the table?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Why is it that as one number gets bigger, the other number gets smaller?&rdquo; <img alt=""Best_making_5_chart_54e6d7861d81b13a12f91d258d45c666"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/790/max/best_making_5_chart_54e6d7861d81b13a12f91d258d45c666.jpg?1382545727"" /> Once students have completed the book, the activity can be repeated but with a book that has 6 pages.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students then solve the problem using whichever strategy they choose. Then the teacher and the class should establish that the answer is 5. The focus of this lesson isn&rsquo;t the solution 3+2 = 5 but rather making explicit to students all the ways they can go about solving such a problem. However, young learners love to have the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; to things and students won&rsquo;t be able to focus on the next part of the problem until they know the teacher knows that they know the answer.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The teacher should then have students brainstorm all the ways they can solve an addition problem like 3+2. Students should be encouraged to imagine a different strategy than the one they used. Students should talk with a partner first so everyone can have a chance to participate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Once students have been given about 90 seconds to talk, the teacher should bring the class back together. The teacher can use a random calling method such as sticks with students&rsquo; names or can take raised hands. Random calling will ensure that many students get a chance to talk. The teacher will compile a list on the board of all the ways students have come up with.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This list should include:</p>

<ul>

	<li>counting on</li>

	<li>using knowledge of all the ways to make five, such as 0+5, 1+4, 2+3</li>
</ul>

<p>To get variety, the teacher can ask, &quot;Did anyone do it another way?&quot; Students may come up with ways other than those described here; the teacher should include all reasonable responses in the list. The teacher may need to provide a few of the higher level ideas, such as using a subtraction fact or counting on.</p>

<p>Once students have brainstormed ideas, the teacher should give them another chance to talk. The teacher can use the give one/get one procedure. Students stand up and find a friend to talk to. They give the friend one addition strategy and then get one additional strategy.</p>

<p>The pattern continues! We have $11^3=1331$ and $(x+1)^3=x^3+3x^2+3x+1$, and $11^4=14641$ and $(x+1)^4=x^4+4x^3+6x^2+4x+1$. To see why this is happening, let&#39;s start with the simple case of $n = 2$. Here we have $11^2 = 121$ and $(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$. The hundreds digit of $11^2$ is the same as the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(x+1)^2$ and similarly for the tens digit and ones digit. In this case, however, we can start to see what is happening by substituting $x = 10$ in the expression $(x+1)^2$. When $x = 10$ we have $x + 1 = 11$. Moreover, $x^2 = 100$ and $x = 10$ so the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(x+1)^2$ tells us how many hundreds we have (1), the coefficient of $x$ tells us how many tens (2), and the constant term is the number of ones (1).</p>

<p>Now we see why the pattern continues: the binomial theorem tells us how to expand $(x+1)^n$, and the digits of $11^n$ are what we get when we substitute $x=10$. When $n = 3$, we have $$ (x+1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1. $$ Substituting $x = 10$ we find</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 11^3 &amp;= 1000 + 3 \times 100 + 3 \times 10 + 1\\ &amp;= 1331 \end{align} $$</div>

<p>When $n = 4$ we have (using the binomial theorem or successively multiplying polynomials) $$ (x+1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x+ 1. $$ Substituting $x = 10$ we find</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 11^4 &amp;= 10,000 + 4 \times 1,000 + 6 \times 100 + 4 \times 10 + 1\\ &amp;= 14,641 \end{align} $$</div>

<p>So Felicia is right that there is a very close relationship between the coefficients of the polynomial $(x+1)^n$ and the digits of the number $11^n$. The two are not always the same, however, because the coefficients of $(x+1)^n$ depend on $n$ and become larger as $n$ grows. The digits of $11^n$, however, can only range from 0 to 9 because of our decimal system for writing numbers. So when $n = 5$, for example, $$ (x+1)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1. $$ Substituting $x = 10$ we find</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 11^5 &amp;= 100,000 + 5 \times 10,000 + 10 \times 1,000 + 10 \times 100 + 5 \times 10 + 1\\ &amp;= 161,051 \end{align} $$
<p>In this case, both the hundreds and the thousands get regrouped when we write this number in base 10. If we were allowed to put any whole number we like in each place value, then the coefficients of $(x+1)^n$ would give us directly an expression for $11^n$ for all values of $n$.</p>

They come to understand that these different expressions are different names for the same numbers, that properties of operations allow numbers to be written in different but equivalent forms, and that all of these numbers can be represented as points on the number line. In middle grades, they come to see numbers as forming a unified system, the number system, still represented by points on the number line. The whole numbers expand to the integers&mdash;with extensions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and their properties. Fractions expand to the rational numbers&mdash;and the four operations and their properties are extended. A similar evolution takes place in algebra. At first algebraic expressions are simply numbers in which one or more letters are used to stand for a number which is either unspecified or unknown. Students learn to use the properties of operations to write expressions in different but equivalent forms. At some point they see equivalent expressions, particularly polynomial and rational expressions, as naming some underlying thing.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Mike is trying to sketch a graph of the polynomial $$ f(x)=x^3+4x^2+x-6. $$ He notices that the coefficients of $f(x)$ add up to zero $(1 + 4 + 1 -6 = 0)$ and says</p>

<blockquote>This means that 1 is a root of $f(x)$, and I can use this to help factor $f(x)$ and produce the graph.</blockquote>

<p>a. Is Mike right that 1 is a root of $f(x)$? Explain his reasoning.</p>

<p>b. Find all roots of $f(x)$.</p>

<p>c. Find all inputs $x$ for which $f(x)\lt 0$.</p>

<p>d. Use the information you have gathered to sketch a rough graph of $f$.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. Mike is right that 1 is a root of $f(x)$ and we verify this by evaluating $f(1)$, we also see why his reasoning works:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} f(1) &amp;= 1^3 + 4 \times 1^2 + 1 \times 1 - 6 \\ &amp;= 1^3 + 4 + 1 - 6 \\ &amp;= 0. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>The key here is that when we substitute 1 into $f(x)$, all of the powers of $x$ are 1, and so the value of $f(1)$ is simply the sum of the coefficients of $f(x)$. Since the sum of the coefficients of $f(x)$ is 0 this means that $f(1) = 0$ and so 1 is a root of $f(x)$.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>b. By the remainder theorem, since $1$ is a root of $f(x)$, the linear term $x-1$ is a factor of $f$: that is, when we divide $f(x)$ by $x-1$ we know that there will be zero remainder. We find (e.g., by long division, or synthetic division, among other choices) $$ f(x) = (x-1)(x^2 + 5x + 6). $$ Since $x^2 + 5x + 6$ factors as $(x+2)(x+3)$, we conclude $$ f(x) = (x-1)(x+2)(x+3). $$</p>

<p>c. We can use the factored form of $f(x)$ to deduce where $f$ is positive or negative. Since a product of three real numbers is negative when all three are negative, or when exactly one is negative, $f(x)$ gives a negative output when one of two things happens:</p>

<p>So $f(x)$ is negative if and only if $-2\lt x\lt&nbsp;1$ or $x\lt -3$.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>All of $x-1$, $x+2$, and $x+3$ are negative. Since $x+3$ is the largest of the three, this happens when $x+3\lt 0$, which is when $x\lt -3$.</li>
	<li>Exactly one of the three linear terms is negative. Since $x-1\lt x+2\lt x+3$, this could only be true if $x-1\lt 0$ but $x+2\gt 0$, that is, $-2\lt x\lt 1$.</li>
</ul>

<p>d.&nbsp;Since $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial with positive coefficient for $x^3$ this means that it will take large positive values when $x$ is large and positive and large negative values when $x$ is large and negative. This, together with the knowledge of where $f(x)$ takes the value 0, and where $f(x)$ is negative, allows us to draw the following sketch for the graph of $y=f(x)$:</p>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. To investigate the conjecture, we can construct a table in which we choose two integers $m$ and $n$, and look at the sum of the squares, the difference of the squares, and twice the product of $m$ and $n$: $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline m &amp; n &amp; m^2 + n^2 &amp; m^2 - n^2 &amp; 2mn \\ \hline 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\ 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 10 &amp; 8 &amp; 6 \\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 13 &amp; 5 &amp; 12 \\ 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 17 &amp; 15 &amp; 8 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ In most cases, the trick seems to work; the triples (3, 4, 5), (6, 8, 10), and others given in the table are familiar Pythagorean triples. However, when $m = n = 2$, we end up with a triple containing the number zero. Since we cannot have a triangle with a side of length zero, the trick does not always work. However, we suspect that it might work as long as we make sure the three numbers generated are all positive.</p>

<p>b. In order to ensure that the three numbers generated are positive, we restrict to the case in which $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $m &gt; n$. Also, we change the language of the conjecture slightly to reflect that the numbers are lengths of the sides of a right triangle, not the sides themselves:</p>

<blockquote>Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers such that $m &gt; n$. Then the numbers $m^2 + n^2$, $m^2 - n^2$, and $2mn$ are the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.</blockquote>

<p>To prove this, it suffices to prove that when these three numbers are squared, one square is the sum of the other two. In our table, it appeared that $m^2 + n^2$ was always the largest of the three numbers, so we conjecture that $$ (m^2 + n^2)^2 = (m^2 - n^2)^2 + (2mn)^2. $$ Expanding the left side, we obtain $$ (m^2 + n^2)^2 = m^4 + 2m^2 n^2 + n^4. $$ Expanding the right side, we obtain \begin{eqnarray*} (m^2 - n^2)^2 + (2mn)^2 &amp; = &amp; m^4 - 2m^2 n^2 + n^4 + 4m^2 n^2 \\ &amp; = &amp; m^4 + 2m^2 n^2 + n^4. \\ \end{eqnarray*} Because these two expressions are identical, we have proven that $$ (m^2 + n^2)^2 = (m^2 - n^2)^2 + (2mn)^2. $$ Therefore, of the three numbers generated, the square of one is always the sum of the squares of the other two. Furthermore, we know that all three numbers are positive. In particular, $2mn$ is positive because both $m$ and $n$ are positive; and $m^2 - n^2$ is positive because $m &gt; n &gt; 0$. Therefore, by the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem, the three numbers are the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.</p>

<p>c. To find a triangle satisfying the given requirements, we try using Trina&#39;s trick on the integers $m = 13$ and $n = 6$. We get $m^2 + n^2 = 205$, $m^2 - n^2 = 133$, and $2mn = 156$. By the reasoning given above, we know that there is a right triangle with sides of length 133, 156, and 205. Furthermore, the numbers 133, 156, and 205 have no common factors.</p>

<p>The US Department of Energy keeps track of fuel efficiency for all vehicles sold in the United States. Each car has two fuel economy numbers, one measuring efficiency&nbsp;for city driving and one for highway driving. For example, a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta gets 29.0 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city and 39.0 mpg on the highway.</p>

<p>Many banks have &quot;green car loans&#39;&#39; where the interest rate is lowered for loans on cars with high <em>combined</em> fuel economy. This number is not the average of the city and highway economy values. Rather, the combined fuel economy (as defined by the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard) for $x$ mpg in the city and $y$ mpg on the highway, is computed as</p>

<p>$$ {\rm combined}\ {\rm fuel}\ {\rm economy} = \frac{1}{\frac12\left(\frac1x+\frac1y\right)}. $$</p>

<p>a. What is the combined fuel economy for the 2012 Volkswagen Jetta? Give your answer to one decimal place.</p>

<p>b. For most conventional cars, the highway fuel economy is 10 mpg higher than the city fuel economy. If we set the city fuel economy to be $x$ mpg for such a car, what is the combined fuel economy in terms of $x$? Write your answer as a single rational function, $a(x)/b(x)$.</p>

<p>c. Rewrite your answer from (b) in the form of $q(x) + \frac{r(x)}{b(x)}$ where $q(x), r(x)$ and $b(x)$ are polynomials and the degree of $r(x)$ is less than the degree of $b(x)$.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least by part (b), it becomes more convenient to re-write the expressions by $$ \frac{1}{\frac12\left(\frac1x+\frac1y\right)} = \frac{2 x y}{x+y}. $$ We&#39;ll do this at the start, though part (a) could certainly be done using the original form of the expression.</p>

<p>a. For $x=29.0$ mpg and $y =39.0$ mpg, compute that</p>

<p>$$ {\rm combined}\ {\rm fuel}\ {\rm economy} = \frac{2 (29.0)(39.0)}{29.0+39.0} \approx 33.265. $$</p>

<p>To one decimal place, this is 33.3 mpg.</p>

<p>We note that this exercise is an opportunity to pay close attention to units, especially since the units of a harmonic mean of two quantities are not immediately obvious. Represent mpg as $\frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}$ the same computation done with units looks like</p>

<p>$$ \frac{2 \left(29.0 \frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}\right)\left(39.0 \frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}\right)}{29.0 \frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}+39.0 \frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}}\approx 33.265 \frac{ \left(\frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}\right)^2}{\frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}} = 33.265 \frac{\rm miles}{\rm gallon}. $$</p>

<p>b. For $y=x+10$, we have</p>

<p>$$ {\rm combined}\ {\rm fuel}\ {\rm economy} =\frac{2x(x+10)}{2x+10} = \frac{2x(x+10)}{2(x+5)} = \frac{x(x+10)}{(x+5)}. $$</p>

<p>c. A student might calculate this reduction using long division, synthetic division or grouping. For any method, we have</p>

<p>$$ \frac{x(x+10)}{(x+5)} = x+5-\frac{25}{x+5} $$</p>

<p>d. When $x$ is large, $25/(x+5)$ is small. In particular, when $x &gt; 20$, this term is less than 1 so the approximation of $x+5$ is within 1 mpg of the correct value of the combined fuel economy.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>We will let&nbsp;f(t)&nbsp;be the amount of uranium 238 remaining from the sample (measured in grams) after&nbsp;t&nbsp;years. We use billions of years as units of time and we let&nbsp;t=0&nbsp;represent the initial moment when there are 100 grams of uranium 238. &nbsp;Since the uranium decays exponentially, the function&nbsp;f&nbsp;has the form&nbsp;f(t)=ae<sup>&minus;ct</sup>&nbsp;where&nbsp;a&nbsp;and&nbsp;c&nbsp;are positive real numbers. Since we start with 100 grams of uranium,&nbsp;f(0)=100. We also have&nbsp;f(0)=ae<sup>0</sup>=a&nbsp;so this tells us that&nbsp;a=100. We also know that&nbsp;f(4.5)=50&nbsp;because after 4.5 billion years half of the original uranium sample will remain. This means</p>

	<p>100e<sup>&minus;4.5c</sup>=50</p>
	and so e<sup>&minus;4.5c</sup>=$\frac{1}{2}$. Taking natural logarithms of both sides we find c=$\frac{ln12}{&minus;4.5}$ $\approx{0.15}$. So our model for the amount of remaining uranium in the sample is&nbsp;f(t)=100e<sup>&minus;0.15t</sup>.</li>
	<li>
	<p>The first graph shows the amount of uranium in the sample decreasing over time which is accurate. It also shows that after a little over 4 billion years there are only 50 grams of uranium remaining. It has the shape of a decreasing exponential graph and we can also verify that after 9 billion years (two half-lives) there are about 25 grams remaining. So the first graph could be accurate.</p>

	<p>The second graph is linear. Although it shows the correct values at 0 years and after 4.5 billion years, this is incorrect. The linear function will very quickly become zero and already takes too small of a value at 9 billion years.</p>

	<p>The third graph is interesting. In fact it is the same as the first graph except that the variables (amount of uranium and time) have been switched. Thus this could also be accurate. We are used to plotting time as the independent variable but in a situation of exponential decay, either variable can be viewed as independent. The last choice may feel odd but it is an accurate depiction of the relationship between time and the amount of remaining uranium.<br />

	<h2>IM Commentary</h2>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The goal of this task is to represent an exponential relationship by an equation and identify, using knowledge of the context and the structure of the equation, possible graphs for the equation. The teacher may wish to provide more possible graphs to highlight different aspects of the exponential equation. In addition, the teacher will need to make sure that students understand the context, that is that they understand that the half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of the Uranium 238 to decay.

		<li>We are given that $a$ is the amount of folate Sara should get from her diet, and $n$ is the number of vitamin tablets taken, and we want to make a table showing combinations of how she can get the minimum of 400 mg of folate. Because her vitamin tablets contains 50 mg of folate each, we arrive at the following table (there are many possible answers for how this table will look):

			</tbody>
		</table>
		Note that we stop after 8 tablets, as we are told this is the maximum she can take.</li>
		<li>
		<p>To express our answers from (i) and (ii) above using inequalities, we see that a single column in the table from part (i) contains a solution to $50n+a=400$. We also see that each column in the table from part (ii) contains a solution to $50n+a=800$.</p>

		<p>Considering what $n$ and $a$ represent, this provides a basis for creating our inequalities: $n$ represents the number of tablets Sara will take, and so $50n$ represents the total amount of folate Sara receives from her vitamins. As $a$ represents the total amount of folate Sara ingests from her diet, we see that $50n+a$ represents the total amount of folate Sara receives per day.</p>

		<p>Now, since we want the total amount of folate, given by $50n+a$, to be between the minimum of 400 mg and the maximum of 800 mg, we arrive the following linear inequalities, $$50n+a\geq 400$$ $$50n+a\leq 800.$$ Considering the additional information that she cannot take more than 8 tablets per day, we finally have our system of 3 inequalities: $$50n+a\geq 400$$ $$50n+a\leq 800$$ $$0\leq n \leq 8.$$ Note we may abbreviate the first two as $400\leq 50n+a\leq 800$. If we graph this system of inequalities, we arrive at the following graph, where the shaded region is the system&#39;s solution set.</p>

		<p>However, taking a fraction of a vitamin does not make much sense, and so we are only interested in the whole numbers on the $n$-axis, as we saw in our tables. Therefore, our solution set in the context of this problem is specifically the red vertical lines within our region that occur at each whole-numbered $n$-value.</p>

		<p><img alt=""Folate_2_508c49df9d0665950ae5a0932baca52b"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/854/max/Folate_2_508c49df9d0665950ae5a0932baca52b.jpg?1359249060"" /></p>

		<p>For example, if Sara decides to take 3 tablets a day, then she needs to include between 250 mg and 650 mg of folate in her diet, which we see are the two values that corresponded to $n=3$ in our tables.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We now consider if Sara is taking a powdered folate supplement, which she can ingest in any dosage. Our variable $n$ is no longer viable, as Sara is not taking her folate in tablet form. Instead, let $s$ be the amount of folate she receives from the supplement, and let $a$ still represent the amount of folate she receives from her diet. While we cannot possibly list all the possible combinations of supplement and dietary folate, we can algebraically express our solution set.</p>

	<p>Using part (a) as a guide, we see that $a+s$ represents the total amount of folate Sara ingests in a day, and we want this amount to be between 400 and 800 mg. Therefore, our system of inequalities is $$a+s\geq 400$$ $$a+s\leq 800$$ $$0\leq s\leq 400.$$ Note that the third inequality is obtained from the fact that Sara can receive a maximum of 400 mg from the supplement.</p>

	<p>Graphing $a$ against $s$, we arrive at the following graph of our solution set.</p>

	<p><img alt=""Folate_3_1ec7b89f0306d779c8befddd206a7742"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/855/max/Folate_3_1ec7b89f0306d779c8befddd206a7742.jpg?1359249077"" /></p>

	<p>Comparing this graph to the graph from part (a), we see that this time, our entire shaded region is our solution set, and we are not limited to only considering whole numbers because of the change from taking a certain number of tablets to taking a certain number of milligrams.</p>

<p>g. $7x + 3 = 10$</p>

<p>This equation involves multiplication and addition. If we were evaluating for $x$, the order of operations dictates that we would multiply and then add. To undo these operations, it is easiest to cancel them in the opposite order. (Otherwise we run into issues with distribution.) Thus, we first subtract 3 from both sides and then divide by 7: $x = 1$.</p>

<p>h.$ax + c = R$ (solve for $x$)</p>

<p>This equation has the same structure as the previous one. To undo the multiplication and addition, we first subtract $c$ from both sides and then divide by $a$: $x=\frac{R - c}{a}$</p>

<p>i. $13 = 15 - 4x$</p>

<p>This equation has multiplication and subtraction. Order of operations dictate that we would evaluate this equation for a given $x$ by first multiplying by $-4$ and then adding 15, so we will do the inverses in the opposite order. First subtract 15 from both sides, and then divide both sides by $-4$, to get $x = \frac{13 - 15}{-4}=\frac{1}{2}.$</p>

<p>j. $2h = w - 3p$ (solve for $p$)</p>

<p>This equation has the same structure as the previous one. First subtract $w$ from both sides, and then divide by $-3$ to get $p=\frac{2h-w}{-3}=\frac{w-2h}{3}$.</p>

<p>k. $F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$ (solve for $G$)</p>

<p>First multiply both sides by $r^2$, then divide both sides by $Mm$, resulting in $G=\frac{Fr^2}{Mm}$. To create an equation in the same form, simply replace the variables other than $G$ with numbers. For example, the equation $10=\frac{7x}{3}$ is in the same form. We would solve this by multiplying by 3 and dividing by 7, giving $x=\frac{30}{7}$.</p>

<p>a. In $2z+3=0$, we are adding $3$ to some number, $2z$,&nbsp;and getting $0$;&nbsp;therefore that number must be equal to&nbsp;$-3$. So we can write $2z=-3$. In $2z=-3$, $-3$ is double some number $z$, so $z$ must be half of $-3$, so we can write $z=\frac{-3}{2}$.</p>

<p>b. If $7x=0$, that means $7$ times some number is $0$. The only number we&nbsp;can multiply $7$ by to&nbsp;get&nbsp;$0$ is $0$. Therefore, $x=0$.</p>

<p>c. Just like&nbsp;in part (b), this equation is saying &quot;7 times something is 0.&quot; Except in this case, the &quot;something&quot; is $(y-5)$. Therefore we can write $y-5=0$, and $y$ must be $5$.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose we let $x$ denote the speed, in miles per hour, that the canoe would travel with no current. When they are traveling against the current, Jamie and Ralph&#39;s speed will be $x-1$ miles per hour and when they are traveling with the current their speed will be $x+1$ miles per hour. The trip upstream will take $\frac{1}{x-1}$ hours and the trip downstream will take $\frac{1}{x+1}$ hours. There are $\frac{2}{5}$ of an hour in 24 minutes so the total trip lasts for $2\frac{2}{5}$ hours giving us $$\frac{1}{x-1}+ \frac{1}{x+1} = \frac{12}{5}.$$ Multiplying both sides of the equation by $(x-1)(x+1) = x^2-1$ gives $$(x+1) + (x-1) = \frac{12}{5}(x^2-1).$$ This equation simplifies to $\frac{12}{5}x^2 -2x - \frac{12}{5} &nbsp;= 0$ or, after further manipulation, $$6x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0.$$ We can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$: $$x = \frac{5 \pm\sqrt{25+144}}{12}.$$ We have $\sqrt{169} = 13$ so the two solutions are $x = \frac{5\pm13}{12}$ or $x = \frac{3}{2}$ and $x = -\frac{2}{3}$. The second solution does not make any sense in this context as the speed cannot be negative. So Jamie and Ralph are paddling at a rate of $\frac{3}{2}$ miles per hour. Going upstream, the trip takes longer against the current and going with the current the trip is shorter.</p>

<p><em>First mistake</em>:</p>

<p>Here are some possible responses.</p>

<p>I would remind the student of the statement of the distributive property $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ and recall that since $a - c$ is an abbreviation of $a(b + c)$, this also implies $a(b - c) = ab - ac$.</p>

<p>To illustrate the distributive property I would ask the student to evaluate 2(5 - 2) in two ways. Then I would point out that the rule still held when 5 was replaced by $x$.</p>

<p>To illustrate the distributive property I would ask the student to evaluate $2(x-2)$. Then I would point out that the same distribution takes place when the $x - 2$ is the numerator of a fraction.</p>

<p>The student may have a deep conceptual confusion or made have made a &#39;careless&#39; mistake caused by misreading the problem. A blind application of PEMDAS might lead the student to think that multiplication before addition means the expression $2 x-2$ (ignoring the denominator to multiply the numerators) evaluates to $2x - 2$. We should remember that the fraction bar means that the numerator and the denominator are each a term. So, $$ \frac{x-2}{9} = (x-2)(9^{-1}). $$</p>

<p>There are several ways in which the &#39;multiplication by 1&#39; in line 2 might be written: \begin{align} &amp; \frac22 \frac{x-2}{9}, \newline &amp; \frac22 \left( \frac{x-2}{9} \right), \newline &amp; \frac22 \cdot \frac{x-2}{9}. \end{align} Students may not recognize the equivalence of these various expressions.</p>

<p>c. Solve the inequality correctly.</p>

<p><em>Method I.</em> This method minimally corrects the students attempt. $$ \begin{align} \frac{5}{18} - \frac{x-2}{9} &amp; \leq \frac{x-4}{6} \newline \frac{5}{18} - \frac22 \left( \frac{x-2}{9} \right) &amp; \leq \frac33 \left( \frac{x-4}{6} \right) \newline \frac{5}{18} - \frac{2x-4}{18} &amp; \leq \frac{3x-12}{18} \newline 5 - (2x - 4) &amp; \leq 3x - 12 \newline 5 - 2x + 4 &amp; \leq 3x - 12 \newline 9 - 2x &amp; \leq 3x - 12 \newline -5x &amp; \leq -21 \newline x &amp; \geq \frac{21}{5} \newline \end{align} $$</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solve the quadratic equation $$ x^2 = (2x - 9)^2 $$ using as many different methods as possible.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Method 1 </span></strong></p>

<p>We have $$ x^2 = (2x - 9)^2. $$ Expanding the right side yields $x^2 = 4x^2 - 36x + 81$. The two sides of this equation will still be equal if we subtract $x^2$ from each; therefore, we have $3x^2 - 36x + 81 = 0$. We can factor out a 3 to get $3(x^2 - 12x + 27) = 0$. Since the product of 3 and $x^2 - 12x + 27$ is zero, one of the factors must be zero; this means that $x^2 - 12x + 27 = 0$.<br />
<br />
We can factor $x^2 - 12x + 27$ to obtain the equation $$ (x - 3)(x - 9) = 0. $$ Again, we have a product of two factors that is equal to zero; thus one of the two factors must be zero. So either $x - 3 = 0$ or $x - 9 = 0$. If $x - 3 = 0$, then $x = 3$. If $x - 9 = 0$, then $x = 9$. So the only possible solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = 9$. Substituting both of these into the original equation confirms that both are indeed solutions. Therefore, the solution set is $\lbrace 3, 9 \rbrace$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Method 2 </span></strong></p>

<p>We begin the same way we started in Method 1, expanding the right side and rearranging terms to obtain $3x^2 - 36x + 81 = 0$. This time, we subtract 81 from each side to find that $3x^2 - 36x = -81$. Since the two sides of the equation are equal, they will remain equal if we divide each side by 3. So we have $x^2 - 12x = -27$.<br />
<br />
We will now solve the equation by completing the square. We recognize that, when expanded, the perfect square $(x - 6)^2$ contains the terms $x^2$ and $-12x$; it also contains a constant term of $36$. So we will transform the left side into a perfect square by adding 36 to each side of the equation: $$ x^2 - 12x + 36 = -27 + 36 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad (x - 6)^2 = 9 $$ Since the square of $(x - 6)$ is 9, $(x - 6)$ must be 3 or -3. If $x - 6 = 3$, then $x = 9$. If $x - 6 = -3$, then $x = 3$. So $x$ must be either 9 or 3. We can substitute these numbers into the original equation to confirm that they are both solutions. Therefore, the solution set is $\lbrace 3, 9 \rbrace$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Method 3 </span></strong></p>

<p>Again, we start the same way we began Method 1, expanding the right side and rearranging terms to obtain the equation $$ 3x^2 - 36x + 81 = 0. $$ Since we have written the equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with $a = 3$, $b = -36$, and $c = 81$, we may now apply the quadratic formula to see that</p>

<div>$$\begin{align} x &amp; = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\ &amp; = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{36^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 81}}{6} \\ &amp; = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{1296 - 972}}{6} \\ &amp; = \frac{36 \pm 18}{6} \\ &amp; = 6 \pm 3. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 9 and 3. Substituting these values into the original equation confirms that they are both solutions; therefore, the solution set is $\lbrace 3, 9 \rbrace$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Method 4 </span></strong></p>

<p>Since we have a square on each side of the equation, we know that we can rearrange the equation to produce a difference of two squares on one side. This is advantageous because we can factor an expression of the form $a^2 - b^2$ into $(a - b)(a + b)$.<br />
<br />
Since the two sides of the given equation are equal, we know that they will remain equal if we subtract $x^2$ from each side: $$ (2x - 9)^2 - x^2 = 0 $$ We can now factor the left side to obtain $((2x - 9) - x)((2x - 9) + x) = 0$; that is, $(x - 9)(3x - 9) = 0$.<br />
<br />
We now have a product of two factors that is equal to zero; therefore, one of the two factors must be zero. If $x - 9 = 0$, then $x = 9$. If $3x - 9 = 0$, then $3x = 9$, and thus $x = 3$. Thus the only possible values of $x$ are 9 and 3. We can substitute both of these into the original equation to see that they are indeed solutions. Therefore, the solution set is $\lbrace 3, 9 \rbrace$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Method 5 </span></strong></p>

<p>If two real numbers have the same square, then they must either be the same number or be opposites of each other. Therefore, we must have either $x = 2x - 9$ or $x = -(2x - 9)$.<br />
<br />
If $x = 2x - 9$, then $x - 9 = 0$, and thus $x = 9$.<br />
<br />
If $x = -(2x - 9)$, then $x = 9 - 2x$. So $3x = 9$, and thus $x = 3$.<br />
<br />
Thus the only possible solutions to the equation are $x = 9$ and $x = 3$. We can use the original equation to check that each of these is indeed a solution. Therefore, the solution set is $\lbrace 3, 9 \rbrace$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Method 6 </span></strong></p>

<p>Let $f(x) = x^2$ and let $g(x) = (2x - 9)^2$. We are looking for values of $x$ at which the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same value. Therefore, we will try graphing the two functions on the same coordinate plane:<br />
<br />
<img alt=""Quadintersect_d672d5f78c1910ec669f3abb6fc6db19"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/557/large/quadintersect_d672d5f78c1910ec669f3abb6fc6db19.jpg?1332136512"" /><br />
<br />
We are looking for values of $x$ where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are the same; this is equivalent to looking for values of $x$ at which the graph of $f(x)$ and the graph of $g(x)$ have the same height. In other words, we are looking for where the two graphs intersect. From the graph, we see that the two intersection points are (3, 9) and (9, 81).<br />
<br />
The fact that the two graphs intersect at (3, 9) means that when $x = 3$, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are equal to 9. Thus $x^2$ and $(2x - 9)^2$ are equal when $x = 3$, and thus $x = 3$ is a solution to the equation $x^2 = (2x - 9)^2$. Similarly, the intersection point at (9, 81) means that when $x = 9$, both $x^2$ and $(2x - 9)^2$ are equal to 81. So $x = 9$ is also a solution.<br />
<br />
In order to see that these are the only two solutions, we must convince ourselves that the two intersection points we see are the only intersection points of the two graphs. One way to see this is to observe that each graph is a parabola, and the parabola $g(x) = (2x - 9)^2$ is steeper than the parabola $f(x) = x^2$ for values of x outside the viewing window.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the solution set is $\lbrace 3, 9 \rbrace$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Method 7 </span></strong></p>

<p>We want to find values of $x$ for which $x^2 = (2x - 9)^2$; that is, for which $(2x - 9)^2 - x^2 = 0$. Therefore, we define $h(x) = (2x - 9)^2 - x^2$, and look for values of $x$ at which $h(x) = 0$.<br />
<br />
We graph the function $h(x)$:<br />

<br />
To determine when $h(x) = 0$, we need to find values of $x$ at which the height of the graph of $h(x)$ is zero; that is, at which the graph crosses the $x$-axis. This appears to occur at $x = 3$ and at $x = 9$. By substituting both of these values into the original equation, we find that both are indeed solutions. Because the function $h(x)$ is quadratic, we know that its graph is a parabola and can cross the x-axis at most twice. Therefore, we know that $x = 3$ and $x = 9$ are the only solutions. The solution set, then, is $\lbrace 3, 9 \rbrace$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Testing code, please disregard this solution </span></strong></p>

<p>Let $f(x) = x^2$ and let $g(x) = (2x - 9)^2$. We are looking for values of $x$ at which the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same value. Therefore, we will try graphing the two functions on the same coordinate plane:<br />
<br />
<img alt=""Quadintersect_d672d5f78c1910ec669f3abb6fc6db19"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/557/large/quadintersect_d672d5f78c1910ec669f3abb6fc6db19.jpg?1332136512"" /><br />
<br />
We are looking for values of $x$ where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are the same; this is equivalent to looking for values of $x$ at which the graph of $f(x)$ and the graph of $g(x)$ have the same height. In other words, we are looking for where the two graphs intersect. From the graph, we see that the two intersection points are (3, 9) and (9, 81).<br />
<br />
The fact that the two graphs intersect at (3, 9) means that when $x = 3$, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are equal to 9. Thus $x^2$ and $(2x - 9)^2$ are equal when $x = 3$, and thus $x = 3$ is a solution to the equation $x^2 = (2x - 9)^2$. Similarly, the intersection point at (9, 81) means that when $x = 9$, both $x^2$ and $(2x - 9)^2$ are equal to 81. So $x = 9$ is also a solution.<br />

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enrico has discovered a geometric technique for &#39;&#39;completing the square&#39;&#39; to find the solutions of quadratic equations. To solve the equation $x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0$, Enrico draws a square of dimension $x$ by $x$ and attaches 6 strips (3 of dimension 1 by $x$ and 3 of dimension $x$ by 1) to make the picture below:</p>

<p><img alt=""Square_decomposition_23ff18eee25bd27fd0c49c7859855bfa"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/030/small/Square_Decomposition_23ff18eee25bd27fd0c49c7859855bfa.jpg?1392153248"" /></p>

<p>To complete the larger square, Enrico adds 9 squares of dimension 1 by 1. He has 4 of them in his initial expression so he needs five more as shown in the picture. So the picture represents the equation $$ (x+3)^2 = (x^2 + 6x + 4) + 5 $$</p>

<p>a. Explain how Enrico&#39;s method helps find the roots of $x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0$.</p>

<p>b. Help Enrico draw a picture for, and then solve, the equation $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. To solve the equation $(x^2 + 6x + 4) = 0$ using $(x+3)^2 = (x^2 + 6x + 4) + 5$, Enrico can proceed as follows. The second equation can be rewritten as $$ x^2 + 6x + 4 = (x+3)^2 - 5. $$ So the solutions of $x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0$ are the same as the solutions to $(x+3)^2 - 5 = 0$. We can add 5 to both sides obtaining $$ (x+3)^2 = 5 $$ and then taking a square root on both sides gives $$ |x+3| = \sqrt{5}. $$ This has solutions $x = -3 + \sqrt{5}$ and $x = -3 - \sqrt{5}$.</p>

<p>b. For the equation $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$ we can still start with an $x$ by $x$ square representing $x^2$. But this time we want to take away $3x$ from each side of the square. We can do this as in the picture below but we have taken away the 9 small squares (where the rectangles of area $x$ intersect) <em>twice.</em></p>

<p><img alt=""Square_decomposition_e458398b21bdbd2178246452991005c1"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/031/small/Square_Decomposition_e458398b21bdbd2178246452991005c1.jpg?1392174235"" /></p>

<p>This means that the small square, of dimensions $x-3$ by $x-3$ is equal to the big square minus the 6 rectangles of dimension $x$ by $1$ <em>plus</em> 9 (to account for the second time these 9 squares are taken away). In equation form: $$ (x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9. $$ From here we find $$ (x-3)^2 - 5 = x^2 - 6x + 4. $$ Solving as we did in part (a) we find that $x = 3+\sqrt{5}$ and $x = 3-\sqrt{5}$ are the two roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;braking distance, in feet, of a car&nbsp;traveling at $v$ miles per hour&nbsp;is given by $$ d= 2.2v+\frac{v^2}{20}. $$</p>

<p>a. What is the braking distance, in feet, if the car is&nbsp;going 30 mph? 60 mph? 90 mph?</p>

<p>b. Suppose that the car took 500 feet to brake. Use your computations in part (a) to make a prediction about how fast it was going when the brakes were applied.</p>

<p>c. Use a graph of the distance equation to determine more precisely how fast it was going when the brakes were applied, and check your answer using the quadratic formula.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. \begin{eqnarray*} \mbox{At 30 mph, braking distance} &amp;=&amp; d = 2.2(30) + \frac{30^2}{20} = 111 \mbox{ ft.}\\ \mbox{At 60 mph, braking distance} &amp;=&amp; d = 2.2(60) + \frac{60^2}{20} = 312 \mbox{ ft.}\\ \mbox{At 90 mph, braking distance} &amp;=&amp; d = 2.2(90) + \frac{90^2}{20} = 603 \mbox{ ft.} \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>b. From our answers in part (a), we see that the speed for a braking distance of 500 ft is between 60 mph and 90 mph. Estimates within this range can vary, though based on the computations, it is reasonable to predict a velocity closer to 90 than to 60.</p>

<p>c. The figure shows a graph of $d = 2.2v + v^2/20$. We see that the speed corresponding to a braking distance of 500 ft is approximately 80 mph.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Lisa is working with the system of equations $x + 2y = 7$ and $2x - 5y = 5$. She multiplies the first equation by 2 and then subtracts the second equation to find $9y = 9$, telling her that $y = 1$. Lisa then finds that $x = 5$. Thinking about this procedure, Lisa wonders</p>

<blockquote>There are lots of ways I could go about solving this problem. I could add 5 times the first equation and twice the second or I could multiply the first equation by -2 and add the second. I seem to find that there is only one solution to the two equations but I wonder if I will get the same solution if I use a different method?</blockquote>

<p>a. What is the answer to Lisa&#39;s question? Explain. &nbsp;</p>

<p>b. Does the answer to (a) change if we have a system of two equations in two unknowns with no solutions? What if there are infinitely many solutions?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. Fortunately the answer to Lisa&#39;s question is yes, she will get the same answer regardless of which (non-zero) multiples of the equations she takes in order to eliminate a variable. The key fact that makes this work is that the process is reversible so she can also manipulate the new, simpler system ($2x-5y=5$ and $9y=9$) to get back the original system. Concretely, suppose $x=a, y=b$ is a solution to $x+2y=7$ and $2x-5y=5$: for these equations, this means that $a = 5$ and $b = 1$ but this is not essential for the reasoning. So $2a-5b=5$ and $a+2b=7$. Lisa&#39;s first step is to multiply $x+2y=7$ by 2 to get $2x+4y=14$. Since $a+2b=7$ we also have $2a+4b=14$. The second step is to subtract $2x-5y=5$ from $2x+4y=14$ giving the equation $9y=9$. Since $2a-b=5$ and $2a+b=14$ the same reasoning applies to $a$ and $b$. We have just shown that if $x=a$ and $y=b$ is a solution to $2x-5y=5$ and $x+2y=7$ then it is also a solution to $9y=9$ and $x+2y=7$.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same reasoning can be applied going back in the other direction. Briefly, if $x=a$ and $y=b$ is a solution to the pair of equations $9y=9$ and $x+2y=7$, then we can multiply the second equation by 2 and subtract the first equation to give $2x-5y=5$ and $x=a$ and $y=b$ will be a solution to this as well as to $x+2y=7$. This means that the original equations have the same solutions as the simpler, modified version. This argument will apply no matter how Lisa manipulates the equations, as long as the steps are reversible, that is as long as she does not multiply by 0 (undoing this would mean dividing by 0 which is not defined).</p>

<p>b. The method of elimination of variables works for any system of two equations in two unknowns. &nbsp;The reasoning in part (a) applies to any solution $x=a$ and $y=b$ to a system of two linear equations in two unknowns. If there are infinitely many solutions to one set of equations there will be infinitely many solutions to a new set obtained by adding and multiplying the original two equations (as long as the multiple is not 0). Similarly, if there are no solutions to a set of two linear equations in two unknowns there will also be no solutions to a new set obtained by adding and multiplying these (if there were a solution, it would solve the original two equations when the process is reversed as seen in the solution to part (a)).&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The graphs of the two linear equations are shown below:</p>

	<li>
	<p>Note that the $y$ intercept of the line defined by the equation $6x + 17y = 100$ is $\frac{100}{17}$ or about 6. The $y$-intercept of the line defined by the equation $5x + 9y = 86$ is $\frac{86}{9}$ or a little more than 9. The slope of this second line, $-\frac{5}{9}$, is less than the slope of the first, $-\frac{6}{17}$. This means that the lines will meet when $x \gt 0$. An $x$ value near 4 is far too small, however, because the $y$ intercepts differ by more than 3 and the slopes differ by a very small amount (about 0.2). So $x$ will need to be larger than 15 before the blue line drops enough, from the $y$-axis, to meet the red line.</p>

<p>We can check that $(0,-1)$ is a solution to the pair of equations by substituting (plugging in) 0 for $x$ and -1 for $y$ in both equations.</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align} x^2 + y^2 &amp;= 1 \\ (0)^2 + (-1)^2 &amp;= 1 \\ 0 + 1 &amp;= 1 \\ 1 &amp;= 1 \quad \checkmark \\ \\ y &amp;= 2x - 1 \\ -1 &amp;= 2(0) - 1 \\ -1 &amp;= 0 - 1 \\ -1 &amp;= -1 \quad \checkmark \end{align} $$</p>

<p>We have verified that $(0,-1)$ is a solution to the pair of equations.</p>

<p>From the graph, we can see that there is another solution (in Quadrant I). However, it is difficult to visually determine its exact $x$- and $y$-coordinates. To find its exact location we can solve the system of equations by substitution.</p>

<p>Let $(x,y)$ be the intersection point. Since $y=2x-1$ by virtue of the point being on the line, we can substitute the quantity $(2x-1)$ for every $y$ appearing in the equation of the circle. We then simplify as follows: $$ \begin{align} &amp;x^2 + (2x-1)^2 = 1 \\ &amp;x^2 + (2x-1)(2x-1) = 1 \\ &amp;x^2 + 4x^2 - 2x - 2x + 1 = 1 \\ &amp;5x^2 - 4x + 1 = 1 \\ &amp;5x^2 - 4x = 0 \\ &amp;x(5x - 4) = 0 \end{align} $$ $$ \begin{align} x = 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad 5x - 4 &amp;= 0 \\ 5x &amp;= 4 \\ x &amp;= \frac{4}{5} \end{align} $$</p>

<p>If $x=0$, we know $y=-1$, so we have re-discovered the first intersection point we observed. So our second intersection point has $x$-coordinate equal to $\frac{4}{5}$, and we are left only having to now find its $y$-coordinate. We simply substitute $x=\frac45$ in either equation and solve for $y$.</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align} y &amp;= 2x - 1 \ y &amp;= 2\left(\frac45\right)-1 \ y &amp;= \frac85 - 1 \ y &amp;= \frac85 - \frac55 \ y &amp;= \frac35 \end{align} $$</p>

<p>Now we have that $\left( \frac45, \frac35 \right)$ is also a solution.</p>

Again this can be understood in terms of simultaneity; if (x, y) satisfies two equations simultaneously, then the expression for y in terms of x obtained from the first equation should form a true statement when substituted into the second equation. Since a linear equation can always be solved for one of the variables in it, this is a good method when just one of the equations in a system is linear.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider three points in the plane, $P=(-4, 0), Q=(-1, 12)$ and $R=(4, 32)$.</p>

<p>a. Find the equation of the line through $P$ and $Q$.</p>

<p>b. Use your equation in (a) to show that $R$ is on the same line as $P$ and $Q$.</p>

<p>c. Show that $P, Q$ and $R$ are on the graph of the equation $y = x^3 + x^2 - 12 x$.</p>

<p>d. Is it possible for $P, Q$ and $R$ to all lie on a parabola of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Students may try to use slope-intercept form or slope-point form for the equation of a line. Since two points are given, they will find the slope first as rise-over-run or $$m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1) = (12-0)/(-1-(-4)) = 12/3 =4.$$</p>

<p>If they use slope-intercept form, they will then plug one point into the equation, $y=4x+b$ and find $b=16$, so $y=4x+16$.</p>

<p>If they use slope-point form, they will plug a point into $y-y_1=4(x-x_1)$ to get either of the equivalent forms $y=4(x+4)$ or $y-12=4(x+1)$.</p>

<p>2. To see that $R$ is on the same line, students decide if the point $(x,y)=(4,32)$ satisfies their equation from the previous part. For example, given $y=4x+16$, students can verify that $32=4(4)+16$. We conclude that $R$ is on the same line as $P$ and $Q$.</p>

<p>Other solution approaches abound: Students might, for example, also check that the slope between $R$ and either $P$ or $Q$ is 4, so they must lie on the same line.</p>

<p>3. Students will most easily check this by confirming that the equation $y=x^3+x^3-12x$ is true after substituting in the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of each of $P$, $Q$ and $R$.</p>

<p>4. We can argue geometrically as follows: A straight line crosses a parabola at most twice, so since $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are colinear, it cannot be that all three of them are on any parabola. (Note that this answer requires the convention that lines do not count as parabolas. Without this convention, the &quot;degenerate parabola&quot; consisting of the line $y=4x+16$ itself does contain all three points.)</p>

<p>Algebraically, we can proceed by solving the system of equations we get by evaluating the expression $y=ax^2+bx+c$ at the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of $P$, $Q$, and $R$. This gives \begin{eqnarray*} 0&amp;=&amp;a (-4)^2+b(-4)+c\\ 12&amp;=&amp;a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c\\ 32&amp;=&amp;a(4)^3+b(4)+c \end{eqnarray*} Solving the resulting system gives $a=0, b=4$ and $c=16$.</p>

<p>It may be worth remarking that, in this case, the geometric approach proves a more general statement, as it applies to all parabolas, and not just those of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$.</p>

<p>A certain number of Xenon gas molecules are placed in a container at room temperature. If $V$ is the volume of the container and $P(V)$ is the pressure exerted on the container by the Xenon molecules, a model predicts that $$P(V) = \frac{40}{2V-1}-\left(\frac{4}{V}\right)^2$$ for all $V&gt;\frac{1}{2}$.&nbsp; Here the units for volume are liters and the units for pressure are atmospheres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blue line has equation $y=&minus;1.25x+8$ and the red line has equation $y=&minus;0.5x+5.$</p>

<p>a. Region A: Since any point in region A lies on or below the red line and on or below the blue line, it has to be true that the point&#39;s $y$-coordinate has to be less than or equal to $&minus;1.25x+8$ and less than or equal to $&minus;0.5x+5.$ Therefore, the system of inequalities which describes region A is: \begin{eqnarray*} y&amp;\leq&amp;-0.5 x + 5\\ y&amp;\leq&amp;-1.25 x + 8 \end{eqnarray*} Region B: Since any point in region B lies on or below the blue line and on or above the red line, it has to be true that the point&#39;s $y$-coordinate has to be less than or equal to $&minus;1.25x+8$ and greater than or equal to $&minus;0.5x+5.$ Therefore, the system of inequalities which describes region B is: \begin{eqnarray*} y&amp;\geq&amp;-0.5 x + 5\\ y&amp;\leq&amp;-1.25 x + 8 \end{eqnarray*} Region C: Since any point in region C lies on or above the red line and on or above the blue line, it has to be true that the point&#39;s $y$-coordinate has to be greater than or equal to $&minus;1.25x+8$ and greater than or equal to $&minus;0.5x+5.$ Therefore, the system of inequalities which describes region C is: \begin{eqnarray*} y&amp;\geq&amp;-0.5 x + 5\\ y&amp;\geq&amp;-1.25 x + 8 \end{eqnarray*} Region D: Since any point in region D lies on or below the red line and on or above the blue line, it has to be true that the point&#39;s $y$-coordinate has to be greater than or equal to $&minus;1.25x+8$ and less than or equal to $&minus;0.5x+5.$ Therefore, the system of inequalities which describes region D is: \begin{eqnarray*} y&amp;\leq&amp;-0.5 x + 5\\ y&amp;\geq&amp;-1.25 x + 8 \end{eqnarray*} Point p: Since point p lies on the red line and also lies on the blue line, it has to be true that p&#39;s $y$-coordinate is equal to both $&minus;1.25x+8$ and to $&minus;0.5x+5.$ Therefore, the system of equations which describes point p is: \begin{eqnarray*} y&amp;=&amp;-0.5 x + 5\\ y&amp;=&amp;-1.25 x + 8 \end{eqnarray*} Point q: Since point q lies on the red line and also lies on $x$-axis, it has to be true that q&#39;s $y$-coordinate is equal to both $&minus;1.25x+8$ and to $0.$ Therefore, the system of equations which describes point q is: \begin{eqnarray*} y&amp;=&amp;0\\ y&amp;=&amp;-0.5 x + 5\\ \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>b. Many answers are possible. We give one for each region.</p>

<p>The point $(0,0)$ lies in region A: Substituting this point into the inequalities we have \begin{eqnarray*} 0&amp;\leq&amp;-0.5\cdot 0 + 5=5\\ 0&amp;\leq&amp;-1.25\cdot 0 + 8=8, \end{eqnarray*} which is true.</p>

<p>The point $(0,6)$ lies in region B: Substituting this point into the inequalities we have \begin{eqnarray*} 6&amp;\geq&amp;-0.5\cdot 0 + 5 = 5\\ 6&amp;\leq&amp;-1.25\cdot 0 + 8 = 8, \end{eqnarray*} which is true.</p>

<p>The point $(8,10)$ lies in region C: Substituting this point into the inequalities we have \begin{eqnarray*} 10&amp;\geq&amp;-0.5\cdot 8 + 5=1\\ 10&amp;\geq&amp;-1.25\cdot 8 + 8=-2, \end{eqnarray*} which is true.</p>

<p>The point $(10,-1)$ lies in region D: Substituting this point into the inequalities we have \begin{eqnarray*} -1&amp;\leq&amp;-0.5\cdot 10 + 5=0\\ -1&amp;\geq&amp;-1.25\cdot 10 + 8=-4.5, \end{eqnarray*} which is true.</p>

<p>c. We first observe that every point in the 3rd quadrant has negative $x$- and $y$-coordinates. So we have to show that for any point with negative $x$ and negative $y$ coordinates the two inequalities \begin{eqnarray*} y&amp;\leq&amp;-0.5 x + 5\\ y&amp;\leq&amp;-1.25 x + 8 \end{eqnarray*} are satisfied.</p>

<p>Note that for any negative value of $y$, the left hand side of both inequalities will be negative. Similarly, for any negative value of $x$, the right hand side of both inequalities will be positive. It is true that any negative number is smaller than any positive number. Therefore, both inequalities are satisfied for negative values of $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>a. $S$ is the number of trips the first truck makes to a job site, and $T$ is the number of trips the second truck makes to a job site. It follows that</p>

<p>$$ S + T = \text{the total number of trips both trucks make to a job site} $$</p>

<p>b. We know that $x$ and $y$ are the amount of sand, in cubic yards, that the first and second truck can transport, respectively. Then</p>

<p>$$ x + y = \text{the total amount of sand that both trucks can transport together} $$</p>

<p>In other words, the company can transport $x + y$ cubic yards of sand in a single trip using both trucks.</p>

<p>c. We can think of $xS + yT$ in separate terms. The first term, $xS$, multiplies $x$, the amount of sand the first truck can transport, by $S$, the number of trips the first truck makes to a job site. This means</p>

<p>$$ xS = \text{the total amount of sand being delivered to a job site by the first truck} $$</p>

<p>In the second term, $y$, the amount of sand the second truck can transport, is being multiplied by $T$, the number of trips the second truck makes. This means</p>

<p>$$ yT = \text{the total amount of sand being delivered to a job site by the second truck} $$</p>

<p>We then have that</p>

<p>$$ xS + yT = \text{the total amount of sand (in cubic yards) being delivered to a job site by both trucks.} $$</p>

<p>d. From part (c), we know that $xS + yT$ is the total amount of sand, in cubic yards, being delivered to a job site. We also know from part (a) that $S + T$ is the number of total trips being made to a job site. By dividing $xS + yT$ by $S + T$, we are averaging out the amount of sand being transported over the total number of trips. So,</p>

<p>$$ \frac{xS + yT}{S+T} = \text{the average amount of sand being transported per trip.} $$</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proﬁt that a company makes selling an item (in thousands of dollars) depends on the price of the item (in dollars). If $p$ is the price of the item, then three equivalent forms for the proﬁt are: $$ \begin{align} \text{Standard form:}&amp; -2p^2 + 24p - 54 \\ \text{Factored form:}&amp; -2(p - 3)(p - 9) \\ \text{Vertex form:}&amp; -2(p - 6)^2 + 18. \end{align} $$ Which form is most useful for ﬁnding</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The prices that give a proﬁt of zero dollars?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The proﬁt when the price is zero?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The price that gives the maximum proﬁt?</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The factored form gives the values of $p$ that make the profit zero. Since factored form is $-2(p-3)(p-9)$, the profit is zero when $p = 3$ or $p = 9$. The company breaks even if the price charged for the product is $\$3$ or $\$9.$</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The standard form is the easiest one to use to find the profit when the price is zero. Substituting $p = 0$ into the standard form $-2p^2 + 24p - 54$, we see that the profit is $-54$ (in thousands of dollars) when the price is zero. If the company gives the product away for free, it loses $\$54,\!000$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The vertex form shows us what price maximizes profit. From the expression $-2(p-6)^2 + 18$, we see that the maximum profit is $18$ thousand dollars, and it occurs when $p = 6$. The company should charge a price of $\$6$ for this product.</p>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The quantity $(x-4)^2$ is never negative since it is the square of a real number. We have $(x-4)^2 = 0$ only when $x - 4 = 0$. So the expression $(x-4)^2$ has a minimum value of 0 when $x = 4$. This means that the expression $(x-4)^2 + 6$ has a minimum value when $x = 4$ and that minimum value is 6.</p>

	<p>The structure of the expression $(x-4)^2 + 6$ was vital in determining its minimum value as it allows us to focus on the simpler expression $(x-4)^2$ and use the fact that the only real number whose square equals 0 is 0.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In order to write $x^2 - 6x - 3$ as a perfect square plus a number, we focus on the first two terms $x^2 - 6x$. To write $x^2 - 6x$ as a perfect square plus a number note that, for any number $a$, $$(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax +a^2.$$ We have $-6x$ in the expression $x^2 - 6x$ so this means we want $2a = -6$ or $a = -3$. With this choice of $a$ we find $$ x^2 - 6x - 3 = (x-3)^2 -12. $$</p>

	<p>As in part (a), the minimum value will occur when $(x-3)^2 = 0$ or $x = 3$. When $x = 3$ we see that the minimum value is -12.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For $-2x^2 + 4x + 3$ we can work as in parts (a) and (b) but it is convenient to first factor out the leading coefficient of -2: $$ -2x^2 + 4x + 3 = -2\left(x^2 - 2x - \frac{3}{2}\right). $$ Alternatively, we could write $-2x^2 + 4x +3 = -2(x^2 -2x) + 3$. For the expression $x^2 -2x - \frac{3}{2}$ we focus on $x^2 - 2x$ and, working as in part (b), we will want to choose $a = -1$ giving $$ x^2 - 2x - \frac{3}{2} = (x-1)^2 - \frac{5}{2}. $$ Substituting this into the above equality gives $$ -2x^2 + 4x + 3 = -2\left((x-1)^2 - \frac{5}{2}\right). $$ With the alternate expression, we would find $-2x^2 +4x +3 = -2(x-1)^2+5$, the expanded form of the right hand side of this equation (and the form requested in the question). The expression $-2(x-1)^2+5$ takes a maximum value when $(x-1)^2 = 0$ or $x = 1$. When $x = 1$, this maximum value is $5$. We know that the value is a maximum because if $x \neq 1$ then $(x-1)^2 \gt 0$ and so $-2(x-1)^2 \lt 0$ and the value of the expression is less than $5$.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(i) Using properties of exponents we can transform the expressions that describe the amount of the radioactive substance into each other. We have $$300e^{-0.0577t}= 300 (e^{-0.0577})^t = 300\cdot 0.9439^t.$$ Similarly, $$300\cdot (1/2)^{t/12} = 300 ((1/2)^{1/12})^t = 300\cdot 0.9439^t.$$ Finally, $$252.290\cdot 0.9439^{t-3}=252.290\cdot 0.9439^{-3} \cdot 0.9439^t = 300\cdot 0.9439^t.$$</p>

<p>(ii) The first three formulas show that the initial amount of the substance is 300 grams.</p>

<ol>
	<li>This formula lets us read off the fact that the continuous decay rate is 5.77 %. (Note: The substance decays at a rate that is proportional to the amount present at any time and the constant of proportionality is 0.0577.)</li>
	<li>If we substitute $t=12$ we get $Q=300\cdot (1/2).$ Therefore, this formula shows that the half-life of the substance is 12 years.</li>
	<li>Since $1-0.9439=0.0561$ we see from this formula that the annual decay rate is 5.61 %.</li>
	<li>In addition to the annual decay rate, this formula also shows that when $t=3$ we have $Q=252.290$. This means that after 3 year there are 252.290 grams of the substance left.</li>

	<li>The total number of people who have viewed the video via Hillary after hour $n$ is the sum of the number of people who received the video via Hillary after each hour; namely, $1 + 3 + 9 + \cdots + 3^{n-1}$.</li>
	<li>The number of people who have viewed the video not through Hillary is simply the total number of people who have watched the video, $3 + 9 + \cdots + 3^n$, minus the number of people who have watched the video through Hillary, $1 + 3 + \cdots + 3^{n-1}$. Hence, in terms of $n$, the number of people who have watched the video through Michelle and Cory is $$ (3 + 9 + \cdots + 3^n) - (1 + 3 + \cdots + 3^{n-1}) = 3^n - 1. $$</li>
	<li>By introducing the variable $H = 1 + 3 + \cdots + 3^{n-1}$, we can view the total number of people who have watched the video as just $3H$. This can be seen either algebraically (by multiplying and distributing) or intuitively/pictorially by seeing that the number of people who have watched the video through Cory is exactly the same as the number of people who have watched it through Hillary; and the same goes for viewers via Michelle. Hence the number of people who have watched the video through Michelle and Cory is $$ 3H - H = 2H. $$</li>
	<li>Since parts (e) and (f) asked for exactly the same quantity in two different forms, the two expressions we obtained are equal: $$ 2H = 3^n - 1. $$ To determine the value of $H$, we can solve the equation: $$ H = \frac{3^n - 1}{2}. $$</li>
	<li>Using our formula above, we know that the number of people who have viewed the video via Hillary after hour 10 is $$ \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524. $$ Hence the total number of people who have watched the video after hour 10 is $$ 3(29524) = 88572. $$</li>
	<li>From the context, it is assumed that $r$ is a positive integer. If we are starting off with $r$ friends, and each one is sharing the video with $r$ people, then the total number of views after hour $n$ is $$ r + r^2 + r^3 + \ldots + r^n, $$ where $r$ is the number of people who received the video in hour 1, $r^2$ the number of people who received it in hour 2, and so on. By once again focusing on a single friend&#39;s sharing of the video, we see that the number of people who have viewed the video through a single friend after $n$ hours is $$ F = 1 + r + r^2 + \ldots + r^{n-1}. $$ Retracing our steps in parts (e) and (f), we see that the number of people who have viewed the video <u>not</u> through this specific friend after $n$ hours is $$ (r - 1)F = (r + r^2 + \ldots + r^n) - (1 + r + \ldots + r^{n-1}) = r^n - 1, \mbox{ so} $$ $$ F = \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}. $$ Thus the total number of views after $n$ hours is $$ rF = \frac{r^{n+1} - r}{r - 1}. $$</li>

<p>In this solution we count the cubes in rows (or layers):</p>

<ol>
	<li>The top layer has a single cube. The layer below has one cube beneath the top cube plus $4$ new ones making a total of $5$. The third layer below has cubes below these $5$ plus $4$ new ones to make $9$. Continuing to add four each time gives a total of $$ 1+5+9+13+17+21 = 66 $$ cubes in the skeleton tower with six layers.</li>
	<li>Building upon the reasoning established in a), the number of cubes in the bottom ($12$th) layer will be $1 + 4 \times 11$ since it is $11$ layers below the top. So for this total, we need to add $$ 1 + 5 + 9+ \ldots + 45 .$$ One way to do this would be to simply add the numbers. A quicker method which will work for any number of layers is the so-called Gauss method (which the great mathematician reportedly used to sum a large list of whole numbers when he was very young). The idea is to rewrite the sum backward as $$45 + 41 + 37 + \ldots + 1.$$ Now if this list is placed below the previous list we can see that each column sums to $46$. There are $12$ columns so the answer to this problem is half of $12 \times 46 = 552$ or $276$.</li>
	<li>Let $f(n)$ be the number of cubes in the $n^{\rm th}$ layer counting down from the top. Then $f(1)=1$ is the number of cubes in the top layer, $f(2)=5$ the number of cubes in the second layer from the top and so on. In this case, the values of the function $f(1), f(2), f(3), \ldots$ form an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained from the previous one by adding $4$. In general, we have $f(n) = 4(n-1) + 1$. The method used to solve problem b) provides a method both to solve the skeleton tower problem and to add a general arithmetic sequence. For the skeleton tower problem, with $n$ layers in the tower, the sum giving the total number of cubes will be $$ 1 + 5 + 9 + \cdots + f(n) = 1 + 5 + 9 + \cdots + (4(n-1)+1). $$ If we use the method of problem b) here, twice this sum will be equal to $n(4(n-1)+2)$ and so the general solution for the number of cubes in a skeleton tower with $n$ layers is $$ \frac{n(4(n-1)+2)}{2} = n(2n-1). $$</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Arithmetic Sequence, Variation 2 </span></p>

<p>In this solution we count the cubes in columns.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The top layer has a single cube and there are five layers of cubes below this one making $6$ total cubes in the column with the top one. The next layer introduces $4$ new cubes and there are four layers below so this gives a total of $20$ cubes in these $4$ columns. Similarly, each successive layer introduces 4 new columns, so we calculate the total to be $$ 6 + 4 \times 5 + 4 \times 4 + 4 \times 3 + 4 \times 2 + 4 \times 1 = 66.$$</li>
	<li>Imitating the method used in the first problem, we find that the column under the cube on top has 12 cubes. Then there are four columns which are 11 cubes high, four columns which are 10 cubes high, and so on down to four columns which are one cube high. Adding this all up gives $$ 12 + 44 + 40 + \ldots + 4. $$ We can simplify this to $$ 12 + 4(11+10 + \ldots + 1). $$ The sum of the first eleven positive integers is found to be 66 (either by hand or by the method indicated in problem c) below). Thus there are $12 + 4 \times 66 = 276$ cubes in this tower.</li>
	<li>Using the reasoning developed in a) and b), the general skeleton tower problem with $n$ layers has a total of $$ n + 4((n-1) + (n-2) + \ldots + 1) $$ cubes. In order to evaluate the sum $((n-1) + (n-2) + \ldots +1)$ we list the same sum backward, that is $(1+2+ \ldots + (n-1))$, beneath it. When we add the columns created by the two sums, each adds to $n$. Since there are $n-1$ columns, the total of the two sums is $n(n-1)$. Thus, the sum $((n-1) + (n-2) + \ldots + 1)$ will be half this or $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. Thus the total number of cubes in the skeleton tower with $n$ layers is $$ n + 4 \times\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 2n^2 -n. $$</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we imagine the playing field as a 32-by-32 grid of pixels, then the snake starts as a 4-by-1 rectangle of pixels, and grows in length as it eats the pellets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After the first pellet, it grows in length by one pixel.</li>
	<li>After the second pellet, it further grows in length by two pixels.</li>
	<li>After the third pellet, it further grows in length by three pixels.</li>
	<li>and so on, with the $n$-th pellet increasing its length by $n$ pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let $L(n)$ denote the length of the snake after eating $n$ pellets. For example, $L(3)=10$.</p>

<p>a. How long is the snake after eating 4 pellets? After 5 pellets? After 6 pellets?</p>

<p>b. Find a recursive description of the function $L(n)$.</p>

<p>c. Find a non-recursive expression for $L(100)$, and evaluate that expression to compute $L(100)$.</p>

<p>d. What is the largest number of pellets a snake could eat before he could no longer fit in the playing field? That is, how long is a perfect game of snake?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a.&nbsp;Since $L(3)=10$, we can most easily compute $L(4)$ by adding 4 to $L(3)$, to get $L(4)=L(3)+4=10+4=14$, rather than starting from scratch, that is by calculating $L(4)=4+1+2+3+4=14$. Similarly, we find $L(5)=L(4)+5=14+5=19$, and $L(6)=L(5)+6=19+6=25$.</p>

<p>b. Generalizing the previous part, to compute the length after $n$ pellets, we take the length after $n-1$ pellets, and add on $n$ more pixels. Algebraically, this reads</p>

<p>$$ L(n)=L(n-1)+n. $$</p>

<p>To complete the specification of a recursive function, we also need to include a starting value, which we are given as $L(0)=4$.</p>

<p>c. The recursive definition gives $L(100)=L(99)+100$, but this doesn&#39;t particularly help for computing this value. Instead, the &quot;start from scratch&quot; method gives</p>

<p>$$ L(100)=4+1+2+3+\cdots+98+99+100. $$</p>

<p>One particularly neat method for evaluating this proceeds as follows:</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">$$ 1+2+3+\cdots+98+99+100=(1+100)+(2+99)+(3+98)+\cdots+(50+51)=50\cdot&nbsp;101=5050. $$</span></p>

<p>We conclude that $L(100)=4+5050=5054$. After 100 pellets, the snake will be 5054 pixels long.</p>

<p>d. We begin by noting that the 32-by-32 grid of pixels contains $32^2=1024$ pixels, so by the last part the snake definitely runs out of room by the time it eats 100 pellets. We are looking for the largest number $n$ such that $L(n)\lt 1024$, which algebraically takes the form</p>

<p>$$ 4+1+2+3+\cdots+n\lt 1024. $$</p>

<p>Here we can either repeatedly apply the trick of the last part of this problem to solve for $n$ by trial-and-error, or generalize the previous part of the problem to arrive at the formula</p>

<p>$$ 1+2+3+\cdots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}:$$</p>

<p>the method from part (c) applies directly if $n$ is even while if $n$ is odd we find $\frac{n-1}{2}$ groups of $n+1$ along with the middle number $\frac{n+1}{2}$ and, adding these up, we check that the formula still holds. Substituting this formula into $L(n)\lt 1024$, we need to solve</p>

<p>$$ 4+\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\lt 1024, $$</p>

<p>or $n(n+1)\lt 2040$. Again, we have a variety of methods for finding the largest such $n$, ranging from educated trial-and-error to solving the quadratic equation</p>

<p>$$ n^2+n-2040=0 $$</p>

<p>which gives $n\approx 44.7$. With either method, we conclude that the snake can eat 44 pellets before running out of room.</p>

	<p>The average rate of change in the number of households from 1998 to 2004 is $$\frac{104,705-97,107}{2004-1998}\approx 1270\ \text{ thousand/year}.$$ We choose this rate as the annual rate of change in our model, and we approximate the number of households in 1998 by $97,000$.

	</li>
	<li>The original function first subtracted 1998 from its input, then multiplied by $1270$, and finally added 97,000. Thus, the inverse function would subtract 97,000 from its input, divide by $1270$, and then add 1998. Thus, $$h^{-1}(x)=\frac{\left(x-97,000\right)}{1270} +1998$$</li>
	<li>Using the formula for the inverse function from b), we get $h^{-1}(111,000) \approx 2009$. This is the year the number of U.S. households reached 111,000 thousand. Of course, this is extrapolating well beyond the data, so the this prediction must be viewed with caution.</li>

	<li>$\ln(e^3)=3$ because $3$ is the exponent $e$ must be raised to in order to yield $e^3$.</li>
	<li>$\log_b(b^y) = y$ (if $b&gt;0$) because $y$ is the exponent $b$ must be raised to in order to yield $b^y$. In words, when we are finding a logarithm, we are asking &quot;what is the exponent on $b$ in the expression $b^y$?&quot; Under this verbal description of the logarithm, the answer is clearly $y$.</li>
</ol>

<p>b. Part II</p>

<ol>
	<li>From Part I we know that $\log_{10}(100) = \log_{10}(10^2)=2$. So if we raise $10$ to this power, we have $10^{\log_{10}(100)} = 10^2=100$.</li>
	<li>From Part I we know that $\log_{2}(\sqrt{2})=\log_{2}(2^{\frac12})=\frac12$. So if we raise $2$ to this power, we get $2^{\log_{2}(\sqrt{2})} = 2^{\frac12} =\sqrt{2}$.</li>
	<li>Thinking through the steps in the last couple of parts, we realize that $e^{\ln(89)} = 89$ because $\ln(89)$ is by definition the exponent $e$ needs to be raised to in order to yield $89$. If we then raise $e$ to exactly this exponent, the result is $89$.</li>
	<li>By definition, $\log_b(x)$ is the exponent we would raise $b$ to to yield $x$. So if we raise $b$ to that exact exponent, we of course get $x$! This is succinctly stated as the identity$$b^{\log_b(x)} = x \text{ where } b &gt; 0$$</li>

<p>d. No, $t$ is not a function of $C$ because there are values of $C$ that have many values of $t$ associated with them.

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 </span></strong></p>

<p>a. We know that $f$ is a function because for each whole number $1 \leq n \leq 50$ Scott is at exactly one point on the number line. It is important here that the coin flipping and Scott&#39;s movement have already taken place so that $f$ assigns a genuine spot on the number line to each whole number $1 \leq n \leq 50$, not some hypothetical spot to be determined in the future.</p>

<p>b. The statement $f(5) = 5$, in everyday language, means that after $5$ coin flips, Scott is standing on the number $5$ of the number line.</p>

<p>c. To find the probability that $f(3) = 0$ we can list all possible outcomes of the three coin tosses and Scott&#39;s location after those three tosses. In the first column of the table we abbreviate heads by `H&#39; and tails by `T&#39; so, for example $HTH$ means that the first coin toss came out heads, the second was tails, and the third was heads.</p>

<p>There are eight possible outcomes and none of them is at the origin so this means that the probability that Scott is at the origin after three coin tosses is $\frac{0}{8}$ or $0$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Alternate solution for part (c) </span></strong></p>

<p>The third part of this problem can be solved by studying the walk in terms of even and odd numbers. In order to finish at $0$, Scott would have to move the same number of steps to the left and to the right: in other words, he would have to move an even number of times. Three is not an even number so after three moves it is impossible for Scott to be at $0$.</p>

<p>Another way to present this argument is as follows. On the first move, Scott must go to an odd number, either $+1$ or $-1$. On the next move, he must go to an even number, either $0$ or $2$ if the first step was to go to $+1$ or $-2$ or $0$ if the first step was to go to $-1$. This succession of even and odd will continue because an odd number plus or minus one is an even number and an even number plus or minus one is an odd number. So after an odd number of steps Scott must be on an odd number and cannot be on $0$ or any other even number.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we imagine the playing field as a 32-by-32 grid of pixels, then the snake starts as a 4-by-1 rectangle of pixels, and grows in length as it eats the pellets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After the first pellet, it grows in length by one pixel.</li>
	<li>After the second pellet, it further grows in length by two pixels.</li>
	<li>After the third pellet, it further grows in length by three pixels.</li>
	<li>and so on, with the $n$-th pellet increasing its length by $n$ pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let $L(n)$ denote the length of the snake after eating $n$ pellets. For example, $L(3)=10$.</p>

<p>a. How long is the snake after eating 4 pellets? After 5 pellets? After 6 pellets?</p>

<p>b. Find a recursive description of the function $L(n)$.</p>

<p>c. Find a non-recursive expression for $L(100)$, and evaluate that expression to compute $L(100)$.</p>

<p>d. What is the largest number of pellets a snake could eat before he could no longer fit in the playing field? That is, how long is a perfect game of snake?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. Since $L(3)=10$, we can most easily compute $L(4)$ by adding 4 to $L(3)$, to get $L(4)=L(3)+4=10+4=14$, rather than starting from scratch, that is by calculating $L(4)=4+1+2+3+4=14$. Similarly, we find $L(5)=L(4)+5=14+5=19$, and $L(6)=L(5)+6=19+6=25$.</p>

<p>b. Generalizing the previous part, to compute the length after $n$ pellets, we take the length after $n-1$ pellets, and add on $n$ more pixels. Algebraically, this reads</p>

<p>$$ L(n)=L(n-1)+n. $$</p>

<p>To complete the specification of a recursive function, we also need to include a starting value, which we are given as $L(0)=4$.</p>

<p>c. The recursive definition gives $L(100)=L(99)+100$, but this doesn&#39;t particularly help for computing this value. Instead, the &quot;start from scratch&quot; method gives</p>

<p>$$ L(100)=4+1+2+3+\cdots+98+99+100. $$</p>

<p>One particularly neat method for evaluating this proceeds as follows:</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">$$ 1+2+3+\cdots+98+99+100=(1+100)+(2+99)+(3+98)+\cdots+(50+51)=50\cdot&nbsp;101=5050. $$</span></p>

<p>We conclude that $L(100)=4+5050=5054$. After 100 pellets, the snake will be 5054 pixels long.</p>

<p>d. We begin by noting that the 32-by-32 grid of pixels contains $32^2=1024$ pixels, so by the last part the snake definitely runs out of room by the time it eats 100 pellets. We are looking for the largest number $n$ such that $L(n)\lt 1024$, which algebraically takes the form</p>

<p>$$ 4+1+2+3+\cdots+n\lt 1024. $$</p>

<p>Here we can either repeatedly apply the trick of the last part of this problem to solve for $n$ by trial-and-error, or generalize the previous part of the problem to arrive at the formula</p>

<p>$$ 1+2+3+\cdots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}:$$</p>

<p>the method from part (c) applies directly if $n$ is even while if $n$ is odd we find $\frac{n-1}{2}$ groups of $n+1$ along with the middle number $\frac{n+1}{2}$ and, adding these up, we check that the formula still holds. Substituting this formula into $L(n)\lt 1024$, we need to solve</p>

<p>$$ 4+\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\lt 1024, $$</p>

<p>or $n(n+1)\lt 2040$. Again, we have a variety of methods for finding the largest such $n$, ranging from educated trial-and-error to solving the quadratic equation</p>

<p>$$ n^2+n-2040=0 $$</p>

<p>which gives $n\approx 44.7$. With either method, we conclude that the snake can eat 44 pellets before running out of room.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oakland Coliseum, home of the Oakland Raiders, is capable of seating 63,026 fans. For each game, the amount of money that the Raiders&#39; organization brings in as revenue is a function of the number of people, $n,$ in attendance. If each ticket costs \$30.00, find the domain and range of this function.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let $r$ represent the revenue that the Raider&#39;s organization makes, so that $r = f(n).$ Since $n$ represents a number of people, it must be a nonnegative whole number. Therefore, since 63,026 is the maximum number of people who can attend a game, we can describe the domain of $f$ as follows:</p>

<div>$$ \text{Domain } = \{n : 0 \leq n \leq 63,\!026 \text{ and $n$ is an integer}\} $$</div>

<p>The range of the function consists of all possible amounts of revenue that could be earned. To explore this question, note that $r = 0$ if nobody comes to the game, $r=30$ if one person comes to the game, $r=60$ if two people come to the game, etc. Therefore, $r$ must be a multiple of 30 and cannot exceed $30\cdot 63,026 = 1,890,780,$ so we see that</p>

<div>$$ \text{Range} = \{r : 0 \leq r \leq 1,\!890,\!780 \text{ and $r$ is an integer multiple of $30$} \}. $$</div>

<p>Solutions are asked to be put in the format of a report. We include below a sample collection of the most relevant pieces of information -- alternatives abound.</p>

<p>Looking at the graph, it seems that there were four intervals in which the rate of population change was significantly different; that is, where the slope of the line appeared to change. These intervals are: (0,1), (1,6), (6,10), and (10,12).</p>

<p>The mathemafish population decreased along three of the intervals, but decreased the fastest between 1 and 6 months with a rate of change of &ndash;73.8 fish each month. We begin to see the effects of the EPA intervention around the 6<sup>th</sup> month when the rate of <em>decrease</em> drops from approximately 74 fish per month to 20 fish per month. If not for the intervention, the fluted dropout shark would have decimated the mathemafish population before month 8.</p>

<p>Population in 6<sup>th</sup> month: 103 fish</p>

<p>Current rate of change: &ndash;73.8 fish/month</p>

<p>$$ y = 103 - 73.8x $$</p>

<div>\begin{align} 0 &amp;= 103 \text{ fish} - \left(73.8 \frac{\text{fish}}{\text{month}}\right)\left(x \text{ months}\right) \\ \left(73.8 \frac{\text{fish}}{\text{month}}\right)(x \text{ months}) &amp;= 103 \text{ fish} \\ x &amp;\approx 1.39 \text{ months} \\ \end{align}</div>

<p>$$ 6 + 1.39 = 7.39 \text{ months} $$</p>

<p>Additionally, because of the intervention, by month 10 we even begin to see the population <em>increase</em> with a rate of change of 11 fish/month. If the EPA intervention remains effective, we can expect to see continued growth in the mathemafish population.</p>

<p>Note the asterisks in the table: this is because we need to calculate differences, second differences, and quotients over <em> equal </em> intervals. With no population data to put in for 1941 we use the 1939 population as if it were the 1941 population.</p>

<p>A linear model can show the general trend of growth in the population but will not account for the changing rate of growth or for the decrease in the final decades. A good linear approximation will overestimate for the first few data points and then underestimate when the growth becomes faster in the middle of the period covered by the table. For accuracy a linear model can provide a reasonable fit to the data but it misses other important aspects of the growth.</p>

<p>There are two choices for a quadratic model, one which is concave up (with the rate of growth increasing over time) and one which is concave down (with the rate of growth decreasing over time). Another way of saying this is that a concave up quadratic model will have positive second differences while a concave down quadratic model will have negative second differences. Looking at the data, up through 1901 this can be very well approximated by a quadratic model with positive leading coefficient (concave up). But after 1901 two of the second differences are markedly negative which means that the rate of growth is now decreasing and a concave down quadratic is called for. With separate quadratics (one for 1801-1901 and one for 1901-1961) we could get a very good model. A single quadratic, however, will either miss the rapid growth over the first 100 years or the slowing growth over the last 60 years.</p>

<p>An exponential model fits the data extremely well for the first 120 years of the data as we can see that the successive quotients are all lie within a small range. Over the next 40 years the growth rate slows down dramatically and then for the 20 final years it begins to decrease. No single exponential model will be able to capture all three of these trends.</p>

<p>b.</p>

<p>Below is an application which allows you to vary the three parameters $a, b,$ and $c$. Preliminary values have been set showing that the general shape of the London population can be captured by this logistic equation. (Note: At the moment, the graph displays a very zoomed out set of axes when viewed in Firefox. The graph appears correctly in chrome.)</p>

</p>

<p>We can visually see the influence each parameter has on the shape of the graph (by clicking on the button in the left hand column next to the given parameters) and this is described mathematically in the next part of the question.</p>

<p>c.</p>

<p>To understand the shape of the graph of $P(t)$ we begin with the exponential function in the denominator. Since $b$ is a positive number $e^{-b(t-c)}$ steadily decreases as $t$ increases. The parameter $b$ controls how fast this decay is. The larger $b$ is, the more rapidly the exponential function will decay: since the exponential function is the denominator, as it decays the value of the function $P$ increases and so the graph is steeper when $b$ is larger.

<p>$$ P(c) = \frac{a}{1 + e^0} = \frac{a}{1 + 1}. $$</p>

<p>When $t$ is large on the other hand, $e^{-b(t-c)}$ will be very small and so the approximate value of $P$ will be $a$.

<p>Summing this up, the parameter $a$ determines how large the values of the function $P$ become as time grows. The parameter $b$ determines how rapidly the population $P(t)$ increases: the larger the value of $b$, the shorter the time span of rapid growth and the more rapid that growth is. The parameter $c$ moves the graph to the left or right without influencing the overall shape so it determines <em> when </em> the rapid growth period happens.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a.</p>

<p>When you graph these four equations, only two different parabolas are shown. This is because the first three equations are equivalent, and so all produce the same graph. We can see the equivalence as follows:</p>

<p>The fourth function produces a different graph. We can see that the difference between it and $y_2$ is just 4, so that graph is 4 units below the other one.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>If we multiply the factors given in the first equation, we&rsquo;ll get the second equation:</p>
	$$ \begin{align} &amp;(x - 3)(x + 1) = \\ &amp;x^2 - 3x + 1x - 3 = \\ &amp;x^2 - 2x - 3 \end{align} $$</li>
	<li>
	<p>Similarly, if we multiply out the perfect square and combine like terms in the third equation, we also get the second one:</p>
	$$ \begin{align} &amp;(x - 1)^2 - 4 = \\ &amp;x^2 - 2x + 1 - 4 = \\ &amp;x^2 - 2x - 3 \end{align} $$</li>
</ul>

<p>b.</p>

<p>The vertex is $(1, &shy;-4)$ which is most visible in $y_3$ since the vertex occurs at the point where the squared portion is zero.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The $y$-&shy;intercept is $(0, &shy;-3)$, which is visible as the constant in $y_2$ since the other terms are 0 when you plug in $x = 0&shy;$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The $x$-&shy;intercepts are $(3,0)$ and $(-&shy;1, 0)$, which are most visible in $y_1$ since you can find the roots of the polynomial using the zero&shy;factor property and thus the intercepts correspond to the zeros of each factor.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>c.</p>

<p>Note: each of these problems has many possible answers. We&rsquo;re including three possible answers for each one, to demonstrate the type of variability you might expect to see in a class. Asking students for three possible answers is a great extension for students - it gets them thinking about the effects of the different parts of the equation.</p>

	<p>The following have a vertex at $(&shy;-2,-&shy;5)$ : $$ \begin{align} y &amp;= (x + 2)^2 - 5 \\ y &amp;= &shy;-(x + 2)^2 - 5 \\ y &amp;= 3(x + 2)^2 - 5 \end{align} $$</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The following have $x$-intercepts at the origin and $(-&shy;4,0)$: $$ \begin{align} y &amp;= x(x + 4) \\ y &amp;= 12x(x + 4) \\ y &amp;= &shy;-x(x + 4) \end{align} $$</p>

<p>At the beginning of the week, Jessie had \$500 in her bank account. She deposited a check for \$50 on Monday and then paid \$250 in rent on Wednesday. On Friday, Jessie deposited \$200 in the account and then on Saturday she paid \$100&nbsp;for groceries from her bank account.

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>According to Jessie&#39;s graph, her bank account had \$500 at the beginning of Monday and steadily went up to about \$550 on Tuesday. There was no activity on Tuesday but on Wednesday the account went down to \$300. On Thursday the account remained at \$300 and then went up to about \$500 on Friday. On Saturday the account went back down to about \$400 where it stayed on Sunday. On each day where the balance changed, Jessie&#39;s graph shoes the balance changing continuously over that period.</p>

	<p>This is not realistic. When we make a withdrawal or deposit to a bank account, that amount is either deducted or added <em> all at once </em> rather than continuously over a period of time. Though not realistic, Jessie&#39;s graph does capture the overall up and down behavior of her bank balance.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>According to the analysis in part (a), we could better capture the behavior of the bank balance by showing it changing (up or down) in jumps and then maintaining a stable value until the next transaction:</p>

	<p>This graph shows a deposit on Monday, a withdrawal on Wednesday, a deposit on Friday, and a withdrawal on Saturday. Notice also the closed and open points at the end of the intervals: for example, the closed point on Monday at about \$550 and the corresponding open point at \$500 indicate that this is the moment when the deposit was made so that the account balance has changed at this instant on Monday.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Many computer applications use very complex mathematical algorithms. The faster the algorithm, the more smoothly the programs run. The running time of an algorithm depends on the total number of steps needed to complete the algorithm. For image processing, the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the image increases.</p>

<p>For an $n$-by-$n$ image, algorithm 1 has running time given by $p(n) = n^3+3n+1$ and algorithm 2 has running time given by $q(n)=15n^2+5n+4$ (measured in nanoseconds, or $10^{-9}$ seconds ).</p>

<p>a. Compute the running time for both algorithms for images of size 10-by-10 pixels and 100-by-100 pixels.</p>

<p>b. Graph both running time polynomials in an appropriate window (or several windows if necessary).</p>

<p>c. Which algorithm is more efficient?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a.</p>

<p>For a 10-by-10 image, the two algorithms take respectively</p>

<p>$$ p(10) = 10^3 + 3 (10) + 1 = 1031\quad\quad\text{ and }\quad\quad q(10)=15 (10^2) + 5(10) + 4 = 1554 $$</p>

<p>nanoseconds.</p>

<p>For a 100-by-100 image, we have</p>

<p>$$ p(100) = 100^3+3(100)+1 = 1,\!000,\!301\quad\text{ and }\quad q(100)=15 (100^2) + 5(100) + 4 = 150,\!504 $$</p>

<p>nanoseconds.</p>

<p>It is already interesting to note that Algorithm 1 runs faster on the 10-by-10 image, whereas Algorithm 2 runs faster on the 100-by-100 image.</p>

<p>b.</p>

<p>We need several windows to see all the important features of the two graphs. The first graph shows the running times for very small images. In fact, and we can see that initially the running time for algorithm 1 is shorter.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>As $a$ changes, the graph of the function $f(x)$ shifts horizontally. The function has a vertical asymptote at $x=-a$, otherwise the functions are exactly the same.</p>

	<p>As $b$ changes the graph of $g(x)$ takes on three different shapes. It either has no vertical asymptote when $b\gt0$, 1 asymptote when $b=0$ or 2 asymptotes when $b\lt0$.</p>

	<p>There are many more observations students can make, e.g.: If $b$ get large then $g(x)$ hugs the line $y = 0$, or if $a$ and $b$ are the same positive number, then the functions cross the y axis at the same point. There are many others.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The denominator of $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{x+a}}$ is zero when $x=-a$. This is true for all values of $a$. Therefore, the graph of $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{x+a}}$ has one vertical asymptote at $x=-a$. If $a=0$ we have $\displaystyle{f(x)=\frac{1}{x}}$. We can obtain all other functions by computing $f(x+a)$ which is is a horizontal shift of $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{x}}.$</p>

	<p>Depending on the value of $b$, the denominator of $\displaystyle{g(x)=\frac{1}{x^2+b}}$ has 0, 1, or 2 zeros.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>When $b\gt 0$ we have $x^2+b\gt 0$, so the denominator is never zero and therefore, the graph of $g(x)$ does not have any vertical asymptotes. As $b$ approaches zero, the bump in the graph gets higher and higher since the denominator gets smaller and approaches zero for $x$-values close to zero. As $b$ gets larger, the entire denominator gets larger and therefore $g(x)$ has values close to zero for all values of $x$.Therefore, the bump disappears and $g(x)$ hugs the $x$-axis.</li>
		<li>When $b=0$ the graph of $g(x)$ has only vertical asymptote $x=0$.</li>
		<li>When $0\gt b$ we have $x^2+b = (x-\sqrt{-b})(x+\sqrt{-b})$. Therefore the graph of $\displaystyle{g(x) = \frac{1}{(x-\sqrt{-b})(x+\sqrt{-b})}}$ has vertical asymptotes $x=\sqrt{-b}$ and $x=-\sqrt{-b},$ which move farther and farther apart as $b$ moves towards minus infinity.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The $y$-intercept of $f(x)$ is $f(0)=\frac{1}{a}$. The $y$-intercept of $g(x)$ is $g(0)=\frac{1}{b}$. If $a=b$ then the two functions have the same $y$-intercepts.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Suppose $h(t) = -5t^2 + 10t + 3$ is&nbsp;the height of a diver above the water (in meters), $t$ seconds after the diver leaves the springboard.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1. </span></strong></p>

<p>a. The height of the springboard is found by evaluating $h$ at $0$, the instant the diver leaves the springboard:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$$ h(0) = 3 $$</p>

<p>so the springboard is 3 meters above the water.</p>

<p>b. The diver will hit the water when $h(t) = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, the solutions to $h(t) = 0$ are</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$$ t = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{160}}{-10}. $$</p>

<p>One of these values of $t$, namely $t = \frac{-10+\sqrt{160}}{-10}$, is negative and so has no significance relative to the dive. So the diver hits the water after</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$$ t = \frac{10 + \sqrt{160}}{10} $$</p>

<p>seconds or about $2\frac{1}{4}$ seconds.</p>

<p>c. Since we have already determined that the springboard is three meters above the water, we are looking for a second time $t$ for which above the water when</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$$ h(t) = 3. $$</p>

<p>Substituting in the definition of $h(t)$ and re-writing, we are left trying to solve $-5t^2 + 10t = 0$. Factoring this give $5t(-t + 2)= 0$, which occurs only when $t = 0$ and when $t = 2$. The value $t = 0$ is the moment the dive begins and so it is two seconds after the dive, $t=2$, that the diver returns again to the level of the springboard.</p>

<p>d. The graph of $h(t)$ is a parabola. Parabolas are symmetric about the vertical line through the vertex of the parabola. Since $h(0) = h(2) = 3$ the vertex must be at $t = 1$ as this is the only vertical reflection which will interchange the points $(0,3)$ and $(2,3)$ on the graph of $h(t)$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Finding when diver reaches peak by completing the square </span></strong></p>

<p>The last part of the problem can be solved by rewriting the function $h(t)$ and manipulating as follows:</p>

<div>\begin{eqnarray} h(t) &amp;=&amp; -5t^2 + 10t + 3\\ &amp;=&amp; -5\left(t^2 - 2t - \frac{3}{5}\right)\\ &amp;=&amp; -5\left((t-1)^2 -\frac{8}{5}\right)\\ &amp;=&amp; 8 - 5(t-1)^2 \end{eqnarray}</div>

<p>The structure of the expression $8 -(t-1)^2$ shows that $h(t)$ is largest when $t = 1$ and that the maximal value is 8. Thinking back to the first solution, the expression $8 - 5(t-1)^2$ for $h(t)$ also makes it clear that the graph of $y = h(t)$ will be symmetric about $t = 1$, that is $h(1+d)$ will take the same value as $h(1-d)$ namely $8 - 5d^2$.</p>

<p>A preserved plant is estimated to contain $1$ microgram (a millionth of a gram) of Carbon $14$. The amount of Carbon 14 present in the preserved plant is modeled by the equation $$ f(t) = A\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{5730}} $$ where $t$ denotes time since the death of the plant, measured in years, and $A$ is the amount of Carbon $14$ present in the plant at death, measured in micrograms.</p>

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>We are given that $$ f(5000) = 1 $$ since there is one microgram of Carbon 14 remaining in the preserved plant after $5000$ years. This means, using the equation for $f(t)$, that $$ 1 = A\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{5000}{5730}}. $$ Solving for $A$ we find that $$ A = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^{\frac{5000}{5730}}. $$ Evaluating this expression on a calculator we find that there was a little more than $1.8$ micrograms of Carbon $14$ in the plant when it died.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Repeating the reasoning for part (a), we find that $f(10000) = 1$ or $$ 1 = A\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{10000}{5730}} $$ Solving for $A$ here we find $$ A = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^{\frac{10000}{5730}}. $$ Evaluating this expression with a calculator, there were between $3.3$ and $3.4$ micrograms of Carbon $14$ in the plant when it died.</p>

	<p>Because the decrease in the amount of Carbon $14$ remaining in the preserved plant is exponential, it decreases by equal factors over equal intervals. During each of the two periods of $5000$ years it has decreased by a factor of a little over $1.8$. This is reasonable because the half-life of Carbon $14$ is about $5700$ years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The expression for $f$ is ideally suited for revealing the half-life of Carbon $14$. To see why, suppose we denote by $h$ the half-life of Carbon $14$. Then since there are $f(0) = A$ micrograms in the plant when it died, this means that $f(h) = \frac{A}{2}$. Writing out this equation we find $$ A\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{h}{5730}} = \frac{A}{2}. $$ Dividing both sides by $A$ gives $$ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{h}{5730}} = \frac{1}{2}. $$ This equation is true when the exponent $\frac{h}{5730}$ is equal to one, in other words when $h = 5730$. So the half life of Carbon $14$ implied by the equation for $f$ is $5730$ years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Algebraically </span></strong></p>

<p>a. To determine the peak height of Brett&#39;s baseball versus Andre&#39;s baseball, we wish to compare the maximums of the two functions. Algebraically, there are several ways to approach finding the maximum ($h$-coordinate of the vertex) of Brett&#39;s height function, $h(t)$.</p>

<p>We can first rewrite $h(t)$ is vertex form:</p>

<p>$\begin{align} h(t)&amp;=-16t^2+79t+6\\ &amp;=-16\left(t^2-\frac{79}{16}t-\frac{6}{16}\right)\\ &amp;=-16\left(t^2-\frac{79}{16}t+\left(\frac{79}{(2)(16)}\right)^2-\left(\frac{79}{(2)(16)}\right)^2-\frac{6}{16}\right)\\ &amp;=-16\left(t^2-\frac{79}{(2)(16)}\right)^2-(-16)\left(\frac{79}{(2)(16)}\right)^2+6\\ &amp;=-16\left(t^2-\frac{79}{(2)(16)}\right)^2+\frac{6625}{64}. \end{align}$</p>

<p>So, we see that the vertex of $h(t)$ occurs at $\left(\frac{79}{(2)(16)},\frac{6625}{64}\right)$, and so Brett&#39;s baseball reaches a maximum height of $\frac{6625}{64}\approx 103.52$, or approximately 104 feet from the ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that the vertex occurs at $t=\frac{79}{(2)(16)}=\frac{-79}{(2)(-16)}$, which matches the known formula $t=-\frac{b}{2a}$ where $b$ is the coefficient on $t$ and $a$ is the coefficient on $t^2$. If this formula was already known, we could have found $h(t)$ for this $t$-value instead of converting the function into vertex form:</p>

<p>$$h\left(\frac{79}{(2)(32)}\right)=h(2.47)=-16(2.47)^2+79(2.47)+6\approx103.52,$$</p>

<p>or approximately 104 feet above the ground.</p>

<p>We can also find the $t$-coordinate of the vertex by determining the midway point between the two roots of $h(t)$. Setting $h(t)=0$ and using the quadratic formula, we have</p>

<p>$$0=-16t^2+79t+6$$</p>

<p>$$\implies t=\frac{-79\pm\sqrt{79^2-4(-16)(6)}}{2(-16)}$$</p>

<p>$$\implies t=\frac{-79\pm\sqrt{6625}}{-32}$$</p>

<p>$$\implies t\approx 5.01 \mbox{ and } t\approx -0.07$$</p>

<p>To find the midway point between these two numbers, we average them.</p>

<p>$$\frac{5.01+(-0.07)}{2}=2.47$$</p>

<p>This is the same $t$-coordinate we found above, and similarly we evaluate $h(2.47)$ to find a maximum height of Brett&#39;s throw at approximately 104 feet.</p>

<p>Looking at the graph of the height of Andre&#39;s baseball, we see that his throw does not even get higher than 80 feet off the ground. So, Brett&#39;s baseball went higher.</p>

<p>b.</p>

<p>We know that each boy let go of his baseball at $t=0$ seconds. To determine how long each ball was airborne, we need to find the number of seconds, or the $t$-coordinates, when the height of the ball, $h(t)$, is 0.</p>

<p>For Brett, we set his function equal to 0 and determine values of $t$ that make it true. To do this, (if not already done in part (a)) we can use the quadratic formula.</p>

<p>$$0=-16t^2+79t+6$$</p>

<p>$$\implies t=\frac{-79\pm\sqrt{79^2-4(-16)(6)}}{2(-16)}$$</p>

<p>$$\implies t=\frac{-79\pm\sqrt{6625}}{-32}$$</p>

<p>$$\implies t\approx 5.01 \mbox{ and } t\approx -0.07$$</p>

<p>Interpreting these two answers, this means that Brett&#39;s ball has a height of 0 feet at approximately $-0.07$ and at $5.01$ seconds. Negative seconds do not make sense in our situation, as when Brett first threw the ball is considered 0 seconds, and so we see that Brett&#39;s baseball was airborne for about 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Looking at Andre&#39;s graph, we see that the ball left his hands at $t=0$, and then returned to the ground (i.e. had a height of 0) at approximately $t=4.2$. So, Andre&#39;s baseball was airborne for about 4.2 seconds.</p>

<p>c.</p>

<p>By graphing Brett&#39;s height function on the same axes as Andre&#39;s height, we arrive at the following graph: <img alt=""Andre_and_brett_with_9c5fc26188d065061825cc918427f52d"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/850/large/andre_and_brett_with_9c5fc26188d065061825cc918427f52d.jpg?1359241460"" /></p>

<p>Here, we can clearly see that Brett&#39;s throw went higher, as his graph reaches a greater $h$-value, and that his ball is airborne for longer, as his graph &quot;touches down&quot; on the $t$-axis after Andre&#39;s. This supports the conclusions we came to in parts (a) and (b).</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: Graphically </span></strong></p>

<p>a.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can determine which function has the greatest maximum by graphing $h(t)$ on the same set of axes as the graph of Andre&#39;s height function, and visually comparing the heights of the vertices.</p>

<p><img alt=""Andre_and_brett_with_9c5fc26188d065061825cc918427f52d"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/850/large/andre_and_brett_with_9c5fc26188d065061825cc918427f52d.jpg?1359241460"" /></p>

<p>Clearly, we can see here that Brett&#39;s throw reached a maximum height of over 100 feet, while Andre&#39;s throw did not reach above 80 feet. Therefore, Brett&#39;s baseball went higher.</p>

<p>b.</p>

<p>Using our graph, we can interpret &quot;how long has the baseball been airborne?&quot; as &quot;how many seconds until the graph crosses the $t$-axis?&quot; Both boys let go of their baseballs at $t=0$ seconds.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>The table shows that over one year periods, the population increases by approximately the same amount (just a little over 2 million per year). Hence a linear function is appropriate to model the relationship between the population and the year over this short time interval.</li>
	<br />
	<li>The slope of the linear function which will model this relationship will measure the change in population per change in time. Its units will be millions-of-people per year in this problem. A value of 2139 thousand = 2,139,000 for the slope would mean that the population is growing by approximately 2,139,000 people per year.</li>
	<br />
	<li>The population in 1988 was 244,499,000. Mike&#39;s choice for the slope from problem (b) indicates a population growth of about $4\cdot(2,139,000) = 8,556,000$ people between 1988 and 1992. Therefore Mike&#39;s model predicts the 1992 population to be approximately 253,055,000 people. Note the actual population of the United States in 1992 was about 255 million.</li>

<br />
To prove that a linear function grows by equal differences over equal intervals, students draw on the understanding developed in Grade 8 that the ratio of the rise and run for any two distinct points on a line is the same (see the Expressions and Equations Progression) and recast it in terms of function inputs and outputs... The equal intervals can be seen as the runs for two pairs of points. Be-cause these runs have equal length and the ratio of rise to run is the same for any pair of distinct points, the dfferences of the corresponding outputs (the rises) are the same...In the process of this proof, students note the correspondence between rise and run on a graph and symbolic expressions for differences of inputs and outputs (MP.1). Using such expressions has the advantage that the analogous proof showing that exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals begins in an analogous way with expressions for di˙erences of inputs and outputs.</p>

<p>A scientific calculator is not necessary to find a value of $x$ where</p>

<p>$$ \left(1 + \frac{1}{1000}\right)^{1000} &gt; 2. $$</p>

<p>To see this, note that the expanded form of $\left(1+\frac{1}{1000}\right)^{1000}$ contains a one (coming from the product of one thousand ones) and also one thousand terms of the form $1^{999} \times \frac{1}{1000} = \frac{1}{1000}$, coming by choosing $\frac{1}{1000}$ from one of the thousand factors and $1$ from the other 999 factors. All of the other terms are positive and so we have shown the inequality. Raising both sides of the inequality to the $n^{th}$ power gives</p>

<p>$$ \left(1 + \frac{1}{1000}\right)^{1000n} &gt; 2^n. $$</p>

<p>Choose $x = 1000n$ where $n$ satisfies</p>

<p>$$ 2^n &gt; 2000n. $$</p>

<p>Recall that $2^{10}$ is a bit over 1000 (1024), and that $2^5=32$, so $2^{15}$ clearly exceeds $1000 \cdot 2 \cdot 15 = 2000 \cdot 15 =30,000$. So, $2^n&gt; 2000n$ when $n = 15$. It then follows, choosing $x = 1000n$, that</p>

<p>$$ \left(1+ \frac{1}{1000}\right)^{15000} &gt; 2 \cdot 15000. $$</p>

<p>In 1966, a Miami boy smuggled three Giant African Land Snails into the country. His grandmother eventually released them into the garden, and in seven years there were approximately 18,000 of them. The snails are very destructive and had to be eradicated.

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Since it is assumed that the growth is exponential, we write $P(t)=ae^{rt}$ for some constants $a$ and $r$. We are given two data points, namely that $P(0)=3$ and $P(7) =18,000$. (This last value is only an approximation.) From the first data point we get $3 = P(0) =ae^{0t}=a$, so we must have $a=3$. Then $P(7)=18,000$ gives $$ 18,000=3e^{r(7)}. $$ Dividing both sides by 3 and rewriting the equation based on the definition of natural logarithm&nbsp;gives $7r=\ln(6000)$, so $r=\frac{\ln(6000)}{7}\approx 1.24$. So $P(t)=3e^{1.24t}$ for $0 \le t \le 7$. We use this function to model the population, bearing in mind that it is based on approximate data.</li>
	<li>The doubling time is the same no matter what the starting value. It takes the same time for the population to double from 3 to 6, then from 6 to 12, and so on. We calculate the time for the population to double from 3 to 6. So we want to find $t$ such that $$ 6=3e^{1.24t}. $$ Dividing both sides by 3 and using the definition of natural logarithm to rewrite the equation&nbsp;gives $\ln(2)=1.24 t$, so $t\approx 0.56$. It takes just over half a year for the population to double.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;
	<ol>
		<li>After 6 years the population is $$ P(6) = 3e^{1.24(6)}\approx 5100. $$ If it costs \$1 million to clean up 18,000 snails, then it would cost $\frac{5100}{18000}\times \$1\text{ million}\approx \$ 280,000$ to clean up 5100 snails. This makes sense since the number of snails doubles almost two times per year, so the population (and the cost of dealing with it) should be a little more than $\frac14$ what it is in the 7th year.</li>
		<li>After 8 years the population is $$ P(8) = 3e^{1.24(8)}\approx 61000. $$ So, since it costs \$1 million to clean up 18,000 snails, it would cost $\frac{61000}{18000}\times \$1\text{ million}\approx \$ 3,400,000$ to clean up 61,000 snails. This makes sense since the number of snails doubles almost two times per year, so the number of snails (and the cost of dealing with them) should be a little less than 4 times what it is in the 7th year.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Solution that does not use logarithms </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>Since it is assumed that the growth is exponential, we write $P(t)=ab^t$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. We are given two data points, namely that $P(0)=3$ and $P(7) =18,000$. (This last value is only an approximation.) From the first data point we get $3 = P(0) =ab^0=a$, so we must have $a=3$. Then $P(7)=18,000$ gives $$ 18,000=3b^7. $$ Dividing both sides by 3 and raising both sides to the power of $\frac{1}{7}$&nbsp;gives $b=6000^{\frac{1}{7}}$, so $b\approx 3.47$. So $P(t)=3(3.47)^t$ for $0 \le t \le 7$. We use this function to model the population, bearing in mind that it is based on approximate data.</li>
	<li>The doubling time is the same no matter what the starting value. It takes the same time for the population to double from 3 to 6, then from 6 to 12, and so on. We calculate the time for the population to double from 3 to 6. So we want to find $t$ such that $$ 6=3(3.47)^t. $$ Dividing both sides by 3 gives $2=3.47^t$. Without logarithms, we can solve by graphing $y = 2$ and $y = 3.47^t$ on the same $xy$-plane and finding $t$ where the graphs intersect.&nbsp;&nbsp;We find&nbsp;$t\approx 0.56$. It takes just over half a year for the population to double.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;
	<ol>
		<li>After 6 years the population is $$ P(6) = 3(3.47)^6\approx 5100. $$ If it costs \$1 million to clean up 18,000 snails, then it would cost $\frac{5100}{18000}\times \$1\text{ million}\approx \$ 280,000$ to clean up 5100 snails. This makes sense since the number of snails doubles almost two times per year, so the population (and the cost of dealing with it) should be a little more than $\frac14$ what it is in the 7th year.</li>
		<li>After 8 years the population is $$ P(8) = 3(3.47)^8\approx 61000. $$ So, since it costs \$1 million to clean up 18,000 snails, it would cost $\frac{61000}{18000}\times \$1\text{ million}\approx \$ 3,400,000$ to clean up 61,000 snails. This makes sense since the number of snails doubles almost two times per year, so the number of snails (and the cost of dealing with them) should be a little less than 4 times what it is in the 7th year.</li>

	<li>Use Mike&#39;s model to predict the U.S. population in 1992.</li>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>The table shows that over one year periods, the population increases by approximately the same amount (just a little over 2 million per year). Hence a linear function is appropriate to model the relationship between the population and the year over this short time interval.</li>
	<br />
	<li>The slope of the linear function which will model this relationship will measure the change in population per change in time. Its units will be millions-of-people per year in this problem. A value of 2139 thousand = 2,139,000 for the slope would mean that the population is growing by approximately 2,139,000 people per year.</li>
	<br />
	<li>The population in 1988 was 244,499,000. Mike&#39;s choice for the slope from problem (b) indicates a population growth of about $4\cdot(2,139,000) = 8,556,000$ people between 1988 and 1992. Therefore Mike&#39;s model predicts the 1992 population to be approximately 253,055,000 people. Note the actual population of the United States in 1992 was about 255 million.</li>

	<li>We can see from the diagram that $180^{\circ}$ corresponds to a little bit more than 3 radians. In fact, we can use the 10 degree points to help us get a better estimate. The arc subtended by 1 radian is divided into a little less than 6 equal pieces by the points and the arc subtended by 3 radians is about 1 piece short of half the circle, so $180^{\circ}$ is about $3+\frac{1}{6} \approx 3.17$ radians. Similarly, $360^{\circ}$ is about 6.34 radians: these are both slight over estimates since the arc subtended by 3 radians is a little bit less than 1 piece short of $180^\circ$.</li>

<p>As drawn $m(\angle BAC) = \theta$ and $m(\angle BAC^\prime) = -\theta$. We have $C = (\cos{\theta}, \sin{\theta})$.

<p>$$ C^\prime = (\cos{\theta},-\sin{\theta}). $$</p>

<p>On the other hand, by the definition of sine and cosine of signed angles we have</p>

Since $C^\prime$ is the reflection of $C$ about the $x$-axis it has the same $x$-coordinate as $C$ while the $y$-coordinate of $C^\prime$ is the negative of the $y$-coordinate of $C$: $$ C^\prime = (\cos{\theta},-\sin{\theta}). $$ On the other hand, by the definition of sine and cosine of signed angles we have $$ C^\prime = (\cos{(-\theta)},\sin{(-\theta)}). $$ From these two ways of viewing the coordinates of $C^\prime$ we deduce that</p>

This means that rotating through $-\theta$ radians (for any real number $\theta$) is the same as rotating through $\theta$ radians and then reflecting about the $x$-axis. Rotating through $-\theta$ radians, from $(1,0)$ gives us the point $$ (\cos{(-\theta)},\sin{(-\theta)}). $$ Rotating through $\theta$ radians and reflecting about the $x$-axis gives us the point $$ (\cos{\theta},-\sin{\theta}) $$ and from here we deduce that for any angle $\theta$,</p>

","<h1>Hours of Daylight 1</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to determine how effective solar panels would be at various times of the year it is important to know the amount of daylight at a given location. To be able to make easy calculations, it is often not sufficient to just have tables of data, which are readily available online.</p>

<p>Find an appropriate function that serves as a mathematical model for the hours of daylight in a location of your choice.</p>

<p>Use the model to find the hours of daylight on your birthday.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1) Identify and select variables:</p>

<p>We would like to find a model for the hours of daylight in a specific location. First we pick a location: Rohnert Park, California (author&#39;s home town). Since the amount of daylight changes throughout the year, one variable to consider is time. At different days of the year we have different amounts of daylight, but every year, the cycle repeats itself (more or less), so we don&#39;t have to work with dates, just with days of the year. Daylight can be measured in hours and minutes, so this is another variable in the model.</p>

<p>(2) Formulate a model:</p>

<p>The amount of daylight is a periodic function of the day of the year. We will find a function $f(t)$ that gives the amount of daylight, in hours, on day $t$ of the year. We assume that every year follows the exact same pattern, which is a slight simplification of reality.</p>

<p>There are many websites that give sunrise/sunset data. For example</p>

<p><a class=""newWindow"" href=""http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php"">http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php</a></p>

<p>A section of the data is shown here:</p>

<p><img alt=""Data_a8530747e873a0f219b65e5e52a09140"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/027/large/data_a8530747e873a0f219b65e5e52a09140.jpg?1392097866"" /></p>

<p>In the full data table we have 365 days of sunrise and sunset data. We can use it to compute the amount of daylight during the day. Rather than computing the hours of daylight for every day, we only need two days if we choose a sinusoidal function to model the data - the longest and the shortest day.</p>

<p>The longest day is June 21 with sunrise at 0447 (4:47 am) and sunset at 1938 (7:38 pm). This gives 14 hours and 51 minutes of daylight. We convert this number to hours and get $14+51/60 = 14.85$ hours.</p>

<p>The shortest day is December 21 with sunrise at 7:24 and sunset at 16:54, which gives $9+30/60 = 9.5$ hours of daylight. Therefore we are looking for a sinusoidal function with amplitude equal $(14.85-9.48)/2 = 2.68$ hours and midline $(14.85+9.5)/2 = 12.175$ hours. The period of the function is 365. If we choose $t=0$ to correspond to June 21, the longest day of the year, we can use a cosine function without horizontal shift for our model:</p>

<p>$f(t) = 2.675\cos(2\pi/365 t)+12.175.$</p>

<p>A graph of the function shows all important features:</p>

<p><img alt=""Hours_from_0_130c1c40e7a84ef14a5f5a82d905a336"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/033/large/hours_from_0_130c1c40e7a84ef14a5f5a82d905a336.jpg?1392600320"" /></p>

<p>(3)(4)(5) Use the model and see if the answer makes sense:</p>

<p>We are asked to use the model to find the hours of daylight on our birthday. My birthday is January 14, which is 207 days after the longest day of the year. Therefore,</p>

<p>$f(207) = 2.675\cos(2\pi/365 \cdot 207)+12.175 \approx 9.734.$</p>

<p>So on my birthday there are about 9 hours and 44 minutes of daylight. This number seems reasonable given that January 14 is a little more than 3 weeks after the shortest day of the year with 9.5 hours of daylight.</p>

",http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/attachments/000/009/439/original/public_task_1832.pdf?1462396903,"Provided by Illustrative Mathematics","<p>Because sin t oscillates between -1 and 1, A +&nbsp;B sin(Ct+D) will oscillate between A-B and A + B. Thus, y=A is the midline, and B is the amplitude of the sinusoid. Students can obtain the frequency of f: the period of sin t is 2&pi;, so (knowing the effect of multiplyingt by C) the period of sinCt is 2&pi;/C, and the frequency is its reciprocal. When modeling, students need to have the sense that C affects the frequency and that C and D together produce a phase shift, but getting these correct might involve technological support, except in simple cases.</p>

<p>For example, students might be asked to model the length of the day in Columbus, Ohio. Day length as a function of date is approximately sinusoidal, varying from about 9 hours, 20 minutes on December 21 to about 15 hours on June 21. The average of the maximum and minimum gives the value for the midline, and the amplitude is half the difference. So A &asymp; 12:17 , and B &asymp; 2:83. With some support, students can determine that for the period to be 365 days (per cycle) (or the frequency to be 3651 cycles/day), C = 2&pi;/365, and if day 0 corresponds to March 21, no phase shift is needed, so</p>

D = 0. Thus,<br />
From the graph, students can see that the period is indeed 365 days, as desired, as it takes one year to complete the cycle. They can also see that two days are approximately 14 hours long, which is to say that f(t) =14 has two solutions over a domain of one year, and they might use graphing or spreadsheet technology to determine that May 1 and August 10 are the closest such days. Students can also see that f (t) = 9 has no solutions, which makes sense because 9 hours, 20 minutes is the minimum length of day.</p>

<p>$$ \left(\frac{|AB|}{|AC|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{|BC|}{|AC|}\right)^2 = 1. $$</p>

<p>We also know that $\frac{|AB|}{|AC|} = \cos{\theta}$ and $\frac{|BC|}{|AC|} = \sin{\theta}$ so we have $\sin^2{\theta} + \cos^2{\theta} = 1$.</p>

<p>For the cases illustrated by the diagram (in which the terminal side of angle &theta; does not lie on an axis) and the definitions of sin &theta; and cos &theta;, students can reason that, in any quadrant, the lengths of the legs of the reference triangle are |x| and |y|. It then follows from the Pythagorean Theorem that (|x|)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+ (|y|)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;= 1. Because (|a|)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;= a<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;for any real number a, this equation can be written x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+ y<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;= 1. Because x = cos &theta; and y = sin &theta;, the equation can be written as sin<sup>2</sup>(&theta;) + cos<sup>2</sup>(&theta;) = 1. When the terminal side of angle &theta; does lie on an axis, then one of x or y is 0 and the other is 1 or -1 and the equation still holds. This argument proves what is known as the Pythagorean identity because it is essentially a restatement of the Pythagorean Theorem for a right triangle of hypotenuse 1.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>We assume the sum angle formula for sine is correct:</p>

<p>$$ \sin(\theta+\phi)= \sin\theta \cos\phi +\cos\theta \sin\phi. $$</p>

<p>a. To derive the difference angle formula for sine, we write $\sin(\theta-\phi)$ as $\sin(\theta+(-\phi))$ to get</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \sin(\theta-\phi)&amp;=&amp; \sin(\theta+(-\phi))\\ &amp;=&amp; \sin\theta \cos(-\phi) +\cos\theta \sin(-\phi) \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>Since cosine is even and sine is odd, we can simplify $\cos(-\phi)=\cos(\phi)$ and $\sin(-\phi)=-\sin(\phi)$. Substituting, we have</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \sin(\theta-\phi)&amp;=&amp; \sin\theta \cos(-\phi) +\cos\theta \sin(-\phi)\\ &amp;=&amp; \sin\theta\cos\phi - \cos\theta\sin\phi \end{eqnarray*} as desired. That is, $$ \sin(\theta-\phi) = \sin(\theta) \cos(\phi)-\cos(\theta)\sin(\phi). $$</p>

<p>b. To derive the sum angle formula for cosine, use the angle relations $\cos(A) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)$ and $\sin(A)=\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)$ for any angle $A$. We begin by observing that we can write $\cos(\theta+\phi)$ as $\sin(\pi/2-(\theta+\phi))$. Moreover, we can write</p>

<p>$$ \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-(\theta+\phi)\right) = \sin\left(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)-\phi\right) $$</p>

<p>Putting these equalities together we have</p>

<p>$$ \cos(\theta+\phi) = \sin\left(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)-\phi\right) $$</p>

<p>Using the difference angle formula for sine we have</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \cos(\theta+\phi) &amp;=&amp; \sin\left(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)-\phi\right)\\ &amp;=&amp;\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\cos\phi-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)\sin\phi\\ &amp;=&amp; \cos\theta\cos\phi-\sin\theta\sin\phi. \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>We conclude that $$ \cos(\theta+\phi)= \cos\theta \cos\phi -\sin\theta \sin\phi. $$</p>

<p>c. To derive the difference angle formula for cosine, we apply the strategy from (a) and write</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \cos(\theta-\phi)&amp;=&amp;\cos(\theta+(-\phi))\\ &amp;=&amp; \cos\theta \cos(-\phi) -\sin\theta \sin(-\phi). \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>Using the fact that sine is odd and cosine is even we reduce further to get</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \cos(\theta-\phi)&amp;=&amp; \cos\theta \cos(-\phi) -\sin\theta \sin(-\phi)\\ &amp;=&amp; \cos\theta\cos\phi+\sin\theta\sin\phi \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>We conclude that</p>

<p>$$ \cos(\theta-\phi)= \cos\theta \cos\phi +\sin\theta \sin\phi. $$</p>

<p>d. To derive the sum angle formula for tangent, we can write</p>

<p>$$ \tan(\theta+\phi) = \frac{\sin(\theta+\phi)}{\cos(\theta+\phi)} $$</p>

<p>Applying the sum angles for sine and cosine, we have</p>

<p>$$ \tan(\theta+\phi) = \frac{\sin\theta \cos\phi +\cos\theta \sin\phi}{\cos\theta \cos\phi -\sin\theta \sin\phi} $$</p>

<p>In order get tangent into the right hand side, we can substitute the equations $\sin\theta=\tan\theta\cos\theta$ and $\sin\phi=\tan\phi \cos\phi$. With this substitution, we have</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{\sin\theta \cos\phi +\cos\theta \sin\phi}{\cos\theta \cos\phi -\sin\theta \sin\phi} &amp;=&amp; \frac{\tan\theta\cos\theta \cos\phi +\cos\theta \tan\phi \cos\phi}{\cos\theta \cos\phi -\tan\theta\cos\theta \tan\phi \cos\phi}\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{(\cos\theta\cos\phi)(\tan\theta+\tan\phi)}{(\cos\theta\cos\phi)(1-\tan\theta\tan\phi)}\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{\tan\theta+\tan\phi}{1-\tan\theta\tan\phi} \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>In the last two lines, we factored the numerator and denominator and the canceled the common factors. We conclude that</p>

<p>$$ \tan(\theta+\phi) = \frac{\tan\theta+\tan\phi}{1-\tan\theta\tan\phi}. $$</p>

<p>As an alternate route, at the point of</p>

<p>$$ \tan(\theta+\phi) = \frac{\sin\theta \cos\phi +\cos\theta \sin\phi}{\cos\theta \cos\phi -\sin\theta \sin\phi} $$</p>

<p>we could divide each term on the right hand side by $\cos\theta\cos\phi$ to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>e. To derive the difference angle formula for tangent, we apply the sum angle formula for tangent to $\theta+(-\phi)$.</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \tan(\theta-\phi) &amp;=&amp; \tan(\theta+(-\phi))\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{\tan\theta+\tan(-\phi)}{1-\tan\theta\tan(-\phi)}. \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>Since tangent is odd, we can simplify $\tan(-\phi)=-\tan\phi$. With this substitution, we have</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray*} \tan(\theta-\phi) &amp;=&amp; \frac{\tan\theta+\tan(-\phi)}{1-\tan\theta\tan(-\phi)}\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{\tan\theta-\tan\phi}{1+\tan\theta\tan\phi} \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>We conclude that</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 Transformations </span></p>

<p>This first approach to the problem uses transformations of the plane to move the given circle to the circle of radius 1 centered at $(0,0)$.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>To move the center of the circle to $(0,0)$ we need to translate by $-a$ in the $x$-direction and $-b$ in the $y$-direction. This is pictured below:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Circlesim2_31394e54f4f1e2429663a0dbdd4f3ef9"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/951/max/circlesim2_31394e54f4f1e2429663a0dbdd4f3ef9.jpg?1361331332"" /></p>

	<p>In order to transform our circle of radius $r$ centered at $(0,0)$ into a circle of radius 1 centered at $(0,0)$ we can apply a dilation, with center $(0,0)$, with scale factor $\frac{1}{r}$. This is pictured below (in this case $r \gt 1$ so this is a contraction):</p>

	<p><img alt=""Circlesim3_ab1b95e3ef5ad2e8884d37123712b2b7"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/950/max/circlesim3_ab1b95e3ef5ad2e8884d37123712b2b7.jpg?1361330741"" /></p>

	<p>The green arrows show where selected points on the blue circle of radius $r$ map to on the red circle of radius 1.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Part (a) applies to any circle in the plane. If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are two circles then by part (a) both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are similar to the circle of radius 1 with center $(0,0)$. Therefore $C_1$ is similar to $C_2$.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Algebraic manipulations </span></p>

<p>This solution works with the equations of circles and models the geometric transformations with algebraic manipulations.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The circle of radius $r$ centered at $(a,b)$ is given by the solutions of the equation $$ (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2. $$ To transform this into the equation for the circle of radius 1 we may first remove the $a$ from $x - a$ and the $b$ from $y-b$ by substituting $x^\prime = x - a$ and $y^\prime = y - b$. With these new coordinates our equation becomes $$ \left(x^\prime\right)^2 + \left(y^\prime\right)^2 = r^2. $$ This is the equation of a circle of radius $r$ centered at $(0,0)$ in $x^\prime$-$y^\prime$ coordinates. We can now scale $x^\prime$ and $y^\prime$ taking $x^{\prime\prime} = \frac{x^\prime}{r}$ and $\frac{x^{\prime\prime}}{r}$ and, with these coordinates, our equation becomes $$ x^{\prime\prime} + y^{\prime\prime} = 1 $$ the equation of a circle of radius $1$ in $x^{\prime\prime}$-$y^{\prime\prime}$ coordinates. Note, comparing this method to the first solution, that moving from $x$-$y$ coordinates to $x^{\prime}$-$y^{\prime}$ coordinates corresponds to translating the circle by $-a$ in the $x$ direction and $-b$ in the $y$-direction. The second substitution $x^{\prime\prime} = \frac{x^\prime}{r}$ and $y^{\prime\prime} = \frac{y^\prime}{r}$ corresponds to the dilation by a factor of $\frac{1}{r}$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Part (a) applies to any circle in the plane. If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are two circles then by part (a) both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are similar to the circle of radius 1 with center $(0,0)$. Therefore $C_1$ is similar to $C_2$.</p>

For example, consider a dilation of a circle whose center is the center of the dilation. Every point on the circle moves the same distance away, because they were originally all at the same distance from the center. Thus the new figure is also a circle. This reasoning can also be reversed to show that any two circles with the same center are similar. Furthermore, because any circle can be translated so that its center coincides with the center of any other circle, we can see that all circles are similar.</p>

	<p>Since segments $\overline{OB}$, $\overline{OC}$, and $\overline{OA}$ are all radii of the same circle, they are all congruent. Therefore both triangles $COB$ and $COA$ are isosceles triangles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Angles $B$ and $BCO$ are congruent since they are opposite congruent sides of the isosceles triangle $COB$. Similarly angles $A$ and $ACO$ are congruent because they are opposite congruent sides of the triangle $COA$.</p>

	Substituting this into the previous formula we find $$ 2m(\angle A) + 2m( \angle B) = 180 $$ and so $m(\angle A) + m(\angle B) = 90$. Since the measures of the three angles of triangle $ABC$ add to $180$ this means that $m(\angle C) = 90$ and so triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle as desired.</li>

<p>The goal of this task is to show how to draw a circle which is tangent to all three sides of a given triangle: that is, the circle touches each side of the triangle in a single point. Suppose $ABC$ is a triangle as pictured below with ray $\overrightarrow{AO}$ the bisector of angle $A$ and ray $\overrightarrow{BO}$ the bisector of angle $B$:</p>

<p><img alt=""Reflection7_42d21d13eecdfed9569ce4beb0ac26ef"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/325/max/reflection7_42d21d13eecdfed9569ce4beb0ac26ef.jpg?1344724228"" /></p>

	<li>Show that the circle with center $O$ and radius $|OM|$ is inscribed inside triangle $ABC$.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Since ray $\overrightarrow{AO}$ bisects angle $A$ this means that angle $MAO$ is congruent to angle $NAO$. We also know that angles $AMO$ and $ANO$ are both right angles and so they are congruent. Since</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div>\begin{align} m(\angle MOA) &amp;= 180 - m(\angle MAO) - m(\angle AMO) \\ m(\angle NOA) &amp;= 180 - m(\angle NAO) - m(\angle ANO) \end{align}</div>

	<p>Since $m(\angle MAO) = m(\angle NAO)$ and $m(\angle AMO) = m(\angle ANO)$ we conclude that $m(\angle (MOA) = m(\angle NOA)$. Triangles $MAO$ and $NAO$ share side $\overline{AO}$ and so by ASA they are congruent.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, triangles $MAO$ and $NAO$ are right triangles. Their hypotenuses are congruent and they share the congruent angles $MAO$ and $NAO$. If students are familiar with the Hypothenuse Angle congruent theorem, this is sufficient information to conclude that triangles $MAO$ and $NAO$ are congruent.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Segments $\overline{OM}$ and $\overline{ON}$ are corresponding sides of congruent triangles $MAO$ and $NAO$, by part (a), and so they must be congruent.</li>
	<li>
	<p>We will use a new picture with ray $\overrightarrow{BO}$ replaced by ray $\overrightarrow{CO}$</p>

	<p><img alt=""Reflection8_830da0aad30d884f1a785233c99da9ee"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/331/max/reflection8_830da0aad30d884f1a785233c99da9ee.jpg?1344792506"" /></p>

	<p>The argument from part (a) can be produced word for word with the point $P$ replacing $N$. Alternatively, looking at the argument for parts (a) and (b) they used the facts that $ABC$ is a triangle, that $\overrightarrow{AO}$ bisects angle $A$ and that $\overrightarrow{BO}$ bisects angle $B$. Since the vertices of triangle $ABC$ can be labelled in any way we choose, we could switch the labels for $B$ and $C$ and then part (a) would show that triangles $AOM$ and $AOP$ are congruent and part (b) would conclude that $\overline{OP}$ is congruent to $\overline{OM}$.</p>

	<p>As in part (a), students can also use the Hypotenuse Angle congruence theorem to show that triangles $COM$ and $COP$ are congruent ($\overline{CO}$ is congruent to $\overline{CO}$ and angle $MCO$ is congruent to angle $PCO$). It then follows that segments $\overline{OM}$ and $\overline{OP}$ are congruent as they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The circle with center $O$ and radius $|OM|$ meets $\overline{AB}$ at $N$, $\overline{AC}$ at $M$, and $\overline{BC}$ at $P$. Moreover, the radii of the circle at these three points are perpendicular to the segments. This means that the lines $\overleftrightarrow{AC}$, $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$, and $\overleftrightarrow{BC}$ are all tangent lines for the circle. So the circle radius $|OM|$ and center $O$ is inscribed in triangle $ABC$ as pictured below:</p>

Also, since there are $2\pi$ total radians in the central angle of an entire circle, the length of the entire orbital path of the satellite is $$ 6470\text{ km}\cdot 2 \pi \ = \ 12940\pi \text{ km}. $$ Therefore, the distance traveled by the satellite in completing $70\%$ of its orbit is $$ 0.7(12940\pi)\text{ km} \approx 28457 \text{ km}, $$ which is our final answer.</p>

	<li>Briana writes, &#39;&#39;two distinct lines are parallel when they have the same slope.&#39;&#39;</li>
</ol>

<p>Analyze each definition, indicating if it is mathematically correct and if it has any drawbacks.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Rachel&#39;s definition of parallel lines is technically correct: if $\ell$ and $m$ are both perpendicular to a traverse line $t$ then $\ell$ and $m$ are parallel. This definition does, however, have some drawbacks. First, it refers to a transverse line $t$ that is not part of the given information. In other words, we need to choose or construct a transverse $t$. It would be better if we could find an &#39;&#39;intrinsic&#39;&#39; characterization of what it means for $\ell$ and $m$ to be parallel, without reference to other constructions. More seriously, this definition assumes that we know what it means for two lines to be perpendicular. While high school students know both what it means for a pair of lines to be perpendicular and what it means for them to be parallel, the definition of parallel lines does not require any knowledge of right angles and consequently it should not include any language making reference to lines being perpendicular.</li>
	<li>
	<p>It is true that if $\ell$ and $m$ are lines in the plane that do not meet then they are parallel. This is perhaps the most classical and intuitive notion of parallel lines: a pair of &#39;&#39;railroad tracks&#39;&#39; that go on forever without meeting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Briana&#39;s definition has two basic flaws. First, it only applies to lines which have a slope: in particular, Briana&#39;s definition does not tell us whether or not pairs of vertical lines are parallel or whether or not a vertical line is parallel to a non-vertical line. So Briana&#39;s definition fails to cover all possible cases: this can be corrected by adding that all vertical lines are parallel and no vertical line is parallel to a non-vertical line. In addition, like Rachel&#39;s definition, it refers to auxiliary information, in this case the slope of the two lines. While it is true that lines with the same slope are parallel, it is possible to talk about lines being parallel with no reference to slope. Since slope is not needed in the definition, it should not be used except to make connections with prior student knowledge. Slope requires coordinates which is an additional structure on the plane, a structure which Euclid did not have at his disposal.</li>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/242/medium/stretch2_702156f00681f1934882a3c12d129ce5.jpg?1403556600"" /></p>

<p>The image of $f$ is $\triangle A^\prime B^\prime C^\prime$ which is congruent to the original triangle but it is displaced to the left by 3 units. The image of $g$ is $\triangle A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime}$ and it is (visibly) not congruent to $\triangle ABC$.</p>

<p>b.</p>

<p>The map $f$ preserves the angles of $\triangle ABC$ and more generally will preserve any angle because it is a translation: each point in the plane is displaced by the same distance in the same direction but neither distances nor angles are changed.</p>

<p>c.</p>

<p>The map $g$ definitely changes distances. This is most visibly clear for $|AC|$ and $|A^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime}|$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can check that $|AC| = \sqrt{20}$ while $|A^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime}| = \sqrt{148}$. It is also clear from the picture that the angles are not congruent. For a mathematical argument, note that $|AB| = \sqrt{26}$ and $|A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}| = \sqrt{34}$. Since there is a different scale factor between $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{A^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime}}$ on the one hand and&nbsp;&nbsp;$\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}}$ on the other, these triangles are not similar and so their angles are not congruent.</p>

<p>Explain why the shape Lisa has made is a regular octagon.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The key geometric result which will be used repeatedly here is that if $\ell$ and $m$ are lines in the plane meeting at a point $P$, then a reflection of the plane which interchanges $\ell$ and $m$ is the reflection about a line which bisects one of the two pairs of vertical angles made by $\ell$ and $m$. The relationship with origami folds comes from the fact that in this problem the folds are designed to interchange pairs of lines: so we conclude that the crease made by the fold bisects the angles formed by those lines.</p>

<p>We begin by labeling lines for the different creases and analyzing the angles that these lines form where they meet at the center of the square. We label five of the lines only $\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3, \ell_4, \ell_5$, focusing on the bottom left corner of our square:</p>

<p><img alt=""Origamioctagon4_a878637d0a174be70275ae498e0cb3f8"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/125/max/origamioctagon4_a878637d0a174be70275ae498e0cb3f8.jpg?1367613208"" /></p>

<p>We will show that the angles made by each of the adjacent pairs of lines in the picture are 22.5 degrees. Note that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ meet in four right angles: this can be seen by noting that $\ell_1$ is a horizontal line while $\ell_2$ is vertical or by observing that the vertical fold along $\ell_2$ takes the horizontal crease made by $\ell_1$ to itself. Next we examine the fold of the square along the diagonal. Reflection about $\ell_3$ interchanges $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ and so this means that $\ell_3$ must bisect the right angles made by $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$. We saw that these are 90 degree angles so the (acute) angles made by $\ell_1$ and $\ell_3$ are 45 degree angles and the same is true for the (acute) angles made by $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$. Next we analyze the angles made by $\ell_2$ and $\ell_5$. Note that reflection about $\ell_5$ interchanges $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ because $\ell_5$ is the &#39;&#39;crease&#39;&#39; made when $\ell_2$ is folded over to $\ell_3$. This means that the (acute) angles made by $\ell_2$ and $\ell_5$ are half of 45 degrees or 22.5 degrees and the same holds for the (acute) angles made by $\ell_2$ and $\ell_5$. The same folding argument shows that the (acute) angles made by $\ell_1$ and $\ell_4$ and also the (acute) angles made by $\ell_3$ and $\ell_4$ are also 22.5 degrees.</p>

<p>We now label some vertices at the center and bottom left of our octagon and use what we have shown in the previous paragraph to show that this octagon is regular.</p>

<p><img alt=""Origamioctagon5_fcc05eee22b0ee39e188de38446b3a62"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/126/max/origamioctagon5_fcc05eee22b0ee39e188de38446b3a62.jpg?1367696734"" /></p>

<p>We claim that $\triangle aoc$ is isosceles with $\overline{oa}$ is congruent to $\overline{oc}$. To see why note that $m(\angle aob) = m(\angle cob) = 22.5$ by construction. We also know that $\overleftrightarrow{ob}$ is perpendicular to $\overleftrightarrow{ac}$ so by AA $\triangle aob$ is similar to $\triangle cob$. But these triangles share side $\overline{ob}$ and so they are congruent. Therefore $\overline{oa}$ is congruent to $\overline{oc}$. Next we consider $\triangle doc$. We claim that reflection about $\ell_3$ maps $\triangle doc$ to itself. To see why, note that reflection about $\ell_3$ is a symmetry of the square: since our picture was created by bisecting the four lines of symmetry of the square, reflection about $\ell_3$ must map the eight lines in the picture to themselves and in particular it interchanges $\ell_4$ and $\ell_5$. This means that $|oc| = |od|$ and by SAS $\triangle aoc$ is congruent to $\triangle doc$. This means that $|ac| = |dc|$. Applying the same argument repeatedly, or using the eight symmetries of the square, we can conclude that all 8 sides of the octagon are congruent.</p>

<p>Finally, to check that each interior angle of the octagon measures 135$^\circ$, we know that $m(\angle cao) + m(\angle aco) + m(\angle aoc) = 180$. We have already seen that $m(\angle aoc) = 45$ and $\triangle aoc$ is isosceles. From this we deduce that $2m(\angle aco) = 135$. We have $m(\angle(dco) = m(\angle aco)$ and so</p>

<div>\begin{align} m(\angle acd) &amp;= m(\angle aco) + m(\angle dco) \\ &amp;= 2m(\angle aco) \\ &amp;= 135. \end{align}</div>

<p>Applying the same argument repeatedly, or using the symmetries of the square, shows that the octagon has equal sides and equal angles so it is a regular octagon.</p>

<p>b. In what ways is the math book definition of reflection more helpful than Carlos&#39; definition?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. If we model the plane with a piece of paper (imagining that it continues on indefinitely in all directions) modeling translations and rotations is straightforward: for a translation we move the paper (or plane) a fixed distance in some direction and for a rotation we fix a point (the center of the rotation) and then rotate the paper about that point through a fixed angle. Reflections can also be modeled nicely with the piece of paper as we can choose the line of reflection and then flip the piece of paper over while leaving this line fixed. The problem with this model is that if we have points labelled and shapes drawn in the plane it is difficult to &#39;&#39;see&#39;&#39; what happens to them because they are now invisible, facing the table.</p>

<p>Carlos&#39; intuition for a reflection helps circumvent this problem and more effectively visualize the impact of a reflection. Moreover, the trick of flipping over the piece of paper only works for the plane: if we are asked to think about reflections of 3 dimensional Euclidean space then this is no longer possible while the mirror is actually a 3 dimensional model. So the first advantage to Carlos&#39; notion of a reflection is that it links the geometric notion of reflection to common every day experience.</p>

<p>Next, by looking at what happens in a mirror, we can visualize one of the most important properties of reflections, namely that they switch notions of left and right, clockwise and counterclockwise. If we look in a mirror and raise our right arm, our &#39;&#39;reflection&#39;&#39; is raising its left arm. Similarly, if we observe the reflection of a clock in the mirror, two things are apparent: first, the numbers on the clock are difficult to read because they are reflected but secondly and more importantly, the reflected clock is moving in the opposite direction!</p>

<p>The mathematical definition does not provide this intuition or link with experience. It is abstract and is only arrived at after doing concrete work with reflections.</p>

<p>b. Below is a picture of how reflection about $\ell$ works according to the mathematical definition, in the case where $P$ does not lie on $\ell$:</p>

<p><img alt=""Reflecdtiondefinitio_3ab5b6612fdfae0a85299d6e63c91f68"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/245/large/reflecdtiondefinitio_3ab5b6612fdfae0a85299d6e63c91f68.jpg?1368902649"" /></p>

<p>In this case, the reflection of $P$ about $\ell$ is the point $Q$ because $\ell$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{PQ}$.</p>

<p>One advantage to the mathematical definition of reflection about $\ell$ is that it brings out right away the fact that reflections separate the plane into two pieces: the points on $\ell$ which remain in place after the reflection and the two halves of the plane which are swapped by the reflection. It is for this reason that the definition offers two separate scenarios which are analyzed separately. The same issue arises in the mirror image model but is not addressed since the model only gives intuition for what happens to the part of the plane in front of the mirror. A similar structure holds also in three dimensional space but here it requires a plane to separate the space into two &#39;&#39;half spaces&#39;&#39; and accordingly reflections in three space are about planes.</p>

<p>Next, the mathematical definition makes it clear that, for $P$ not on $\ell$, if $r_\ell(P) = Q$ then $r_\ell(Q) = P$: in other words the reflection interchanges pairs of points. We can see this because if $\ell$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{PQ}$ then it is also the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{QP}$. This is not possible to see in the physical model because we would have to place a second mirror in front of the first mirror and, although an interesting experiment, this is awkward to do and also very disorienting if studied closely (because it leads to an infinite regression of reflected images).</p>

<p>Finally and perhaps most importantly, the mathematical definition allows us to study the properties of reflections in more depth. Do reflections preserve distance? What happens if I compose two different reflections? How does moving the line $\ell$ impact the result of the reflection? These questions can be and should be studied with physical models such as Carlos&#39; but in order to make clear arguments and establish results, a precise mathematical definition is required.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>One way to show the congruence is to first translate vertex $A$ to $P$ which is shown below:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Congrunce2_e9b8d01fe03404950c0a56a00f291f8b"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/366/max/congrunce2_e9b8d01fe03404950c0a56a00f291f8b.jpg?1370650051"" /></p>

	<p>The image of $\triangle ABC$ after this translation is denoted $\triangle A^\prime B^\prime C^\prime$. A reflection about the indicated line $\ell$ then completes the congruence between $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle PQR$:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Congrunce3_a533fdb5e66df37ce25cd5d06b16caaf"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/367/max/congrunce3_a533fdb5e66df37ce25cd5d06b16caaf.jpg?1370650414"" /></p>

	<p>This last step assumes that $Q$, $P$, and $B^\prime$ are collinear: they appear to be collinear and in the absence of coordinates we assume that this is the case.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The congruence can not be established with a single translation, rotation, or reflection. Neither a translation nor a rotation can work because the vertices of $\triangle ABC$ are listed in counterclockwise order while those of $\triangle PQR$ are listed in clockwise order. This means that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle PQR$ have opposite orientations. But translations and rotations do not change the orientation and so neither a translation nor a rotation can establish the congruence.</p>

	<p>The argument of the previous paragraph does not apply to reflections because they do change the orientation. Therefore a single reflection could, in principle, work to show that $\triangle ABC$ is congruent to $\triangle PQR$. In order to see that this is not the case, we draw the line segments connecting corresponding vertices of the two triangles:</p>

	<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/368/medium/congrunce4_485578b0c40feca9f364937023a85617.jpg?1477533052"" /></p>

	<p>If a single reflection were to map $\triangle ABC$ to $\triangle PQR$ then the line $\ell$ of the reflection would be the perpendicular bisector of all three red segments. This is not possible and so the congruence can not be shown with a single reflection.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We saw in part (b) that translations preserve orientation and so no composition of translations will be sufficient to show the congruence between $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle PQR$ (since they have opposite orientations). Alternatively, if there were such a translation, it would send $A$ to $P$, $Q$, or $R$ and we can check by hand that none of these work.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>As in part (c), since rotations preserve orientation, no composition of rotations will show the congruence between $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle PQR$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Reflections are sufficient to exhibit this triangle congruence or any other congruence. In this case, for part (a) we used a translation followed by a reflection to exhibit the congruence. So if we can rewrite the translation as a composition of reflections then we will have the entire congruence done by a sequence of reflections.</p>

	<p>The key to realizing a translation as a composition of reflections is to use a pair of lines which are parallel to one another and perpendicular to the direction of translation. Specifically, suppose we let $m$ be the perpendicular to $\overleftrightarrow{CC^\prime}$ through $C$ and $k$ the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{CC^\prime}$ as in the picture below:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Congruence5_58c3190d77d366c356c16573448a37d9"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/369/max/congruence5_58c3190d77d366c356c16573448a37d9.jpg?1370654869"" /></p>

	<p>Reflecting $\triangle ABC$ about $m$ and then about $k$ maps $\triangle ABC$ to $\triangle A^\prime B^\prime C^\prime$. One final reflection about $\ell$ completes the congruence of $\triangle ABC$ with $\triangle PQR$ using three reflections. We already saw that one reflection is never sufficient and two reflections will not work either (because reversing the orientation twice is the same as preserving the original orientation). So three reflections are necessary to show the congruence.</p>

	<p>This configuration will be carefully explained in part (c): the vital issue is to show that $r_\ell(H)$ and $r_m(H)$ share one side as pictured.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We begin by analyzing the reflection of $H$ about $\ell$ more closely. This is pictured below with some points labelled on $H$ and its reflection:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Hexagonreflection4_6b72228a2d1ed19d9985bbeec6c72f29"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/895/medium/hexagonreflection4_6b72228a2d1ed19d9985bbeec6c72f29.jpg?1359749725"" /></p>

	<p>The interior angle $BCF$ of the regular hexagon $H$ measures $120^\circ$. Since reflections preserve angle measures, angle $r_\ell(B)CF$ also measures $120^\circ$. This means that $\angle BCr_\ell(B)$ must also measure $120^\circ$ since it forms a full circle together with angles $BCF$ and $r_\ell(B)CF$. This will be important as we consider the reflection of $H$ over line $m$ joining vertices $B$ and $C$:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Hexagonreflection6_b6fd50cafd3f711d504adcc9dac9109f"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/896/medium/hexagonreflection6_b6fd50cafd3f711d504adcc9dac9109f.jpg?1359750465"" /></p>

	<p>Also pictured is the segment joining points $F$ and $r_\ell(B)$ and the point $P$ where $m$ meets this segment. We know that reflection about $m$ maps $B$ to $B$ and $C$ to $C$ because $B$ and $C$ both lie on $m$. We claim that reflection about $m$ maps $F$ to $r_\ell(B)$. For this it is sufficient to show that $m$ is the perpendicular bisector of segment $\overline{Fr_\ell(B)}$. We will show that this is true by showing that triangles $FPC$ and $r_\ell(B)PC$ are congruent: this will establish both that $\overline{FP}$ and $\overline{r_\ell(B)P}$ are congruent and that angles $FPC$ and $r_\ell(B)PC$ are right angles, making $m$ the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{Fr(B)}$ as desired.</p>

	<p>Segment $\overline{FC}$ is congruent to segment $\overline{BC}$ since both are sides of a regular hexagon. Segment $\overline{r_\ell(B)C}$ is congruent to segment $\overline{BC}$ because reflections preserve distance. Therefore segment $\overline{FC}$ is congruent to segment $\overline{r_\ell(B)C}$. Segment $\overline{PC}$ is congruent to itself. We know that $m(\angle PCF) = 60$ because it is supplementary to the interior angle $BCF$ of a regular hexagon. We know $m(\angle FCr_\ell(B)) = 120$ because it is an interior angle of a regular hexagon. Therefore $$ m(\angle PCr_\ell(B)) = m(\angle FCr_\ell(B)) - m(\angle(PCF)) = 120 - 60 = 60. $$ So angles and $FCP$ and $r_\ell(B)CP$ are congruent. By SAS, triangles $PCr_\ell(B)$ and $PCF$ are congruent.</p>

	<p>We have now shown that reflection about $m$ maps $F$ to $r_\ell(B)$ and so maps $\overline{CF}$ to $\overline{Cr_\ell(B)}$ and so the picture for part (b) is correct. We may now continue this procedure, moving around sides of $H$ in a clockwise fashion, reflecting around the line containing each side. The order in which the reflected hexagons appear is shown in the picture below:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Hexagon3_d0b5ea6e44577186ccc35f12e9768144"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/573/medium/hexagon3_d0b5ea6e44577186ccc35f12e9768144.jpg?1349470134"" /></p>

	<p>At each step, the reflection of $H$ will share one side with the previously reflected hexagon: the explanation for part (b) above applies word for word in each case. When we come to the hexagon marked $6$, this reflected hexagon shares one side with the hexagon $5$ but it also shares a side with hexagon $1$. To see why, consider the following picture:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Hexagonreflection7_025d339850e3908b221488ca37e5c314"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/915/medium/hexagonreflection7_025d339850e3908b221488ca37e5c314.jpg?1360104400"" /></p>

	<p>If we apply the argument of part (b) to the reflections about $\ell^\prime$ and $m^\prime$ (in place of $\ell$ and $m$) this will show that the reflection of $H$ about $\ell^\prime$ (Hexagon 6) will share a side with the reflection of $H$ about $m^\prime$ (Hexagon 1). So the picture of a single regular hexagon surrounded by $6$ regular hexagons can be produced by reflecting $H$ about the $6$ lines containing its sides.</p>

	<li>Using parts (b) and (c), show that a triangle is isosceles if and only if there is a reflection of the plane that preserves the triangle.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Since the reflection over line $L$ leaves each point on $L$ fixed, we have $r_L(A) = A$ since $A$ lies on $L$. Since $B$ and $C$ do not lie on $L$, in order to show that $r_L(B) = C$ and $r_L(C) = B$ we need to show that $L$ is the perpendicular bisector of segment $\overline{BC}$.</p>

	<p>Note that we are given that segment $\overline{AB}$ is congruent to segment $\overline{AC}$. Since $D$ is the midpoint of segment $\overline{BC}$ this means that segment $\overline{BD}$ is congruent to segment $\overline{CD}$. Finally segment $\overline{DA}$ is congruent to segment $\overline{DA}$. So this means, by SSS, that triangle $ABD$ is congruent to triangle $ACD$. Since angles $BDA$ and $CDA$ together add up to 180 degrees and they are congruent it follows that they are both right angles. Therefore $L$ is perpendicular to segment $\overline{AB}$ and it is the bisector of $\overline{AB}$ by assumption.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>From part (a) we know that $r_L(A) = A$, $r_L(B) = C$, and $r_L(C) = B$. Reflections map line segments to line segments so it follows that $r_L$ maps side $\overline{AB}$ to side $\overline{AC}$, side $\overline{AC}$ to side $\overline{AB}$ and side $BC$ to itself. Hence $r_L$ maps triangle $ABC$ to itself. Note that although $r_L$ maps side $\overline{BC}$ of triangle $ABC$ to itself, the map interchanges vertices $B$ and $C$ so the orientation of this segment is reversed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We are given that $r_M$ maps triangle $EFG$ to itself. Suppose we look at $r_M(E)$. Since $r_M$ preserves triangle $EFG$ it must interchange the vertices of $E, F, G$ in some way. One possibility would be that it leaves them all alone, that is $E$ maps to $E$, $F$ maps to $F$, and $G$ maps to $G$. This can not happen, however, because a reflection of the plane can not leave $\triangle EFG$ in its original position. If two of the vertices are preserved by $r_M$ then the third must be also as there is no freedom to send it to either of the two fixed vertices. So this means that the reflection $r_M$ must leave exactly one vertex of $\triangle EFG$ fixed and it must exchange the other two vertices. For simplicity, let&#39;s assume that $r_M(E) = E$, $r_M(F) = G$, and $r_M(G) = F$. This situation is pictured below:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Trireflection_e3740e81dcf00059a5605caa36efd5d8"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/445/max/trireflection_e3740e81dcf00059a5605caa36efd5d8.jpg?1346872037"" /></p>

	<p>Since $r_M$ preserves distances this means that $|EF| = |r_M(EG)| = |EG|$ and so $\triangle EFG$ is isosceles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Part (b) shows that for each isosceles triangle $ABC$ there is at least one line $L$ so that $r_L$ maps triangle $ABC$ to itself. Part (c) shows that if there is a line $L$ so that $r_L$ maps triangle $ABC$ to itself then triangle $ABC$ is isosceles. Putting these two statements together we see that triangle $ABC$ is isosceles if and only if there is a line $L$ so that $r_L$ maps triangle $ABC$ to itself.</li>

<p>Reflection about line $L$ sends point $P$ in the plane to point $Q$ exactly when $L$ is the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>In the first part of this problem, we wish to send $A$ to $D$ via a reflection. So we must reflect about the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ which is pictured below. Also pictured below is the new triangle $DB^\prime C^\prime$ obtained by reflecting triangle $ABC$.</p>
	<img alt=""Gco_8_rigid_motion_a_fc46284f851dcd58abdcc5d48da0fe5c"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/314/large/GCO_8_Rigid_motion_a_fc46284f851dcd58abdcc5d48da0fe5c.jpg?1328324492"" /></li>
	<li>
	<p>In this step we wish to move $B&#39;$ to $E$ and so we must reflect again, this time about the perpendicular bisector of $B&#39;E$. Note that it is important that this perpendicular bisector contains $D$ so that our second reflection preserves what we accomplished in the first step. The reason we know that $D$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $B&#39;E$ is that it is equidistant from $E$ and $B&#39;$ by the hypothesis that $AB$ is congruent to $DE$; and the perpendicular bisector of a line segment $xy$ consists of all points in the plane equidistant from $x$ and $y$. The result of the second reflection is pictured below:</p>
	<img alt=""Gco_8_rigid_motion_a_2bd53ba7faa6dd6c796fd3e07b4fb671"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/315/large/GCO_8_Rigid_motion_a_2bd53ba7faa6dd6c796fd3e07b4fb671.jpg?1328324521"" /></li>
	<li>
	<p>In this last step we must move $C&#39;&#39;$ to $F$ via a reflection while leaving $D$ and $E$ fixed. The only reflection that leaves $D$ and $E$ fixed is the one about line $DE$. So we have to check that reflection about line $DE$ maps $C&#39;&#39;$ to $F$. Angle $FDE$ is congruent to angle $C&#39;&#39;DE$ because angle $C&#39;&#39;DE$ is the image under two reflections of angle $CAB$ which is congruent to angle $FDE$ by hypothesis. Since all rigid motions of the plane preserve angles, angle $C&#39;&#39;DE$ must map to angle $FDE$. Since segment $DF$ is congruent to segment $AC$ by hypothesis and $AC$ is congruent to $DC&#39;&#39;$ (because reflections preserve lengths of line segments) the reflection about line $DE$ maps $C&#39;&#39;$ to $F$. After these three reflections, the triangle $ABC$ has been moved on top of triangle $DEF$ so the two are congruent.</p>

	<p>Note that the first step of this construction does not use any of the hypotheses. The second step uses the fact that $AB$ is congruent to $DE$ and the third step uses the facts that $DF$ is congruent to $AC$ and angle $A$ is congruent to angle $D$.</p>

A variation of this argument can also be used to prove the ASA criterion. In that case one would drop the assumption that |AC| = |PR| (the double hash marks) and add the assumption that mAngle=ABC = mAngle=PQR. Then one would argue at the conclusion that P coincides with the reflection R(T(A)) because line QP coincides with the reflection of line QR(T(A)), and therefore its intersection with line RP must coincide with the reflection of R(T(A)).

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. Below is a picture showing the midpoints of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$ as well as the rotated images of $\triangle ABC$, by 180 degrees about $M$ and $N$:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/244/large/anglesum2_877a825f7ef7f5c36a5f979f368ba4fb.jpg?1403578635"" /></p>

<p>Since the rotation about $M$ is a 180 degree rotation, it maps $\overleftrightarrow{AC}$ to itself. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AC}$ it maps $A$ to $C$ and $C$ to $A$. The point $B$ maps to $B^\prime$ which has the property that $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BB^\prime}$.</p>

<p>b. This is also pictured above. As in the part (a), this rotation interchanges $B$ and $C$ and maps $A$ to the point marked $A^\prime$.</p>

<p>c. We know that 180 degree rotations about $M$ and $N$ map&nbsp; $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ to lines which are parallel to $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$. The rotation about $M$ maps $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ to $\overleftrightarrow{CB^\prime }$ while the rotation about $N$ maps $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ to $\overleftrightarrow{CA^\prime }$. Both of these lines are parallel to $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ and contain $C$. The parallel postulate establishes that $\overleftrightarrow{CB^\prime} = \overleftrightarrow{CA^\prime}$. This means that $A^\prime$, $B^\prime$, and $C$ are collinear.</p>

<p>d. Rotations preserve angle measures so $m(\angle B^\prime CA) = m(\angle BAC)$ and $m(\angle BCA^\prime) = m(\angle CBA)$. We have</p>

<p>$$m(\angle B^\prime CA) + m(\angle ACB) + m(\angle BCA^\prime) = 180&deg;$$</p>

<p>since these three angles make a line. Substituting the equivalent angles gives</p>

<p>$$m(\angle BAC) + m(\angle ACB) + m(\angle CBA) = 180&deg;$$</p>

<p>as desired.</p>

<p>The diagram above consists of the given information, and one additional line segment, $\overline{MD}$, which we will use to demonstrate the result. We claim that triangles $\triangle AMD$ and $\triangle NDM$ are congruent by SAS:</p>

<p>Show that the four angles marked in the picture are congruent.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We begin by showing that the pair of vertical angles where $k$ and $m$ meet are congruent. For this we mark several points on the diagram:</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/238/medium/angles2_28e7f49161be2cb260a738c517bbb14b.jpg?1403116675"" /></p>

<p>We will show that $m(\angle DBC) = m(\angle EBA)$. Note that $\angle DBC$ and $\angle DBA$ are supplementary, together forming a straight angle.&nbsp; So $m(\angle DBC) + m(\angle DBA) = 180$. Similarly, $\angle EBA$ and $\angle DBA$ together make line $k$ and they too are supplementary: $m(\angle EBA) + m(\angle DBA) = 180$. From these two equations we see that $m(\angle DBC) = m(\angle EBA)$. The other pair of vertical angles in the problem, made by $\ell$ and $m$, are congruent by the same reasoning.</p>

<p>To show that all four angles are congruent, it is now sufficient to show, in the picture below, that $m(\angle GBE) = m(\angle BGF)$.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/240/medium/angles4_7700957426452bbfba6cc3b5f1fc2eb7.jpg?1403117820"" /></p>

<p>Here $B$ and $E$ are the same points as in the&nbsp;picure&nbsp;above and we have added points $F$ and $G$ as well as the midpoint $M$ of $\overline{BG}$. A 180 degree rotation of the plane about $M$ maps $B$ to $G$ and $G$ to $B$ since $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BG}$. If $t$ is the line parallel to $k$ and $\ell$ through $M$ then $t$ is mapped to itself by the 180 rotation with center $M$. The rotation maps parallel lines to parallel lines so this means that $k$ must map to the line through $G$ and parallel to $t$, that is $k$ maps to $\ell$. Similar reasoning shows that $\ell$ maps to $k$. This means that the 180 degree rotation with center $M$ interchanges $\angle GBE$ and $\angle BGF$, making these two angles congruent. Combining our congruent vertical angles and congruent alternate interior angles, we have shown that all four angles in the picture are congruent.</p>

<p>There is a second way to show that $m(\angle GBE) = m(\angle BGF)$ using translations and their properties. Suppose we apply a translation by $\overline{GB}$ to the plane. This translation maps $m$ to itself and maps $\ell$ to a line parallel to $\ell$ containing $B$. The only line parallel to $\ell$ through $B$ is $k$ so this means that $\ell$ maps to $k$. Translations preserve angles so this means that $m(\angle BGF) = m(\angle CBD)$ with notation as in the first picture. We already showed that $m(\angle CBD) = m(\angle GBE)$ and so we have shown that $m(\angle BGF) = m(\angle GBE)$.</p>

<p>To summarize the construction: We construct the circle of radius $\overline{AB}$ cenetered at $A$ and the circle of radius $\overline{AB}$ cenetered at $B.$ These intersect at two points, which we label $P$ and $Q$. Then $P$ and $Q$ are both equidistant from $A$ and $B$, and so lie on the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AB}$. We conclude that line $PQ$ is precisely the perpendicular bisector, which is the line over which the first triangle was reflected to arrive at the second.</p>

<p>We remark that the above construction is valid even from the strict Euclidean perspective on straight-edge and compass constructions. In a more modern setting, in which one typically allows the use of a compass with memory, one has a little more flexibility. In particular, we could replace the two circles in the above construction with any pair of circles of equal radius at least $\frac{1}{2}\overline{AB}$, centered at $A$ and $B$.</p>

<p>b. Show that $\triangle PBQ$ is an equilateral triangle inscribed in the given circle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. We know that $|AP| = r$ because it is a radius of our auxiliary circle. We also know that $|AB| = 2r$ since it a diamteter of our given circle of radius $r$:</p>

<p><img alt=""Tri2_f3b1eafd64a27e64543b1c98e7ed45a3"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/423/large/tri2_f3b1eafd64a27e64543b1c98e7ed45a3.jpg?1371575126"" /></p>

<p>Thus</p>

<p>$$ \frac{|AP|}{|AB|} = \frac{1}{2}. $$</p>

<p>Since $\triangle ABP$ is inscribed in a circle and side $\overline{AB}$ is a diameter of this circle, this means that $\angle APB$ is a right angle. Side $\overline{AP}$ is the side opposite angle $ABP$. Therefore</p>

<p>$$ \sin{\angle ABP} = \frac{|AP|}{|AB|} = \frac{1}{2}. $$</p>

<p>This means that $\angle ABP$ is a 30 degree angle.</p>

<p>We can apply the same argument to show that $\angle ABQ$ is a 30 degree angle. Alternatively, since $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ contains the centers of both circles, reflection about $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ maps the two circles to themselves and interchanges $P$ and $Q$. This means that reflection about $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ maps $\angle ABP$ to $\angle ABQ$. Since reflections preserve angle measurements, this means that $m(\angle ABQ) = m(\angle ABP) = 30$.</p>

<p>b. We know that $m(\angle PBQ) = m(\angle ABQ) + m(\angle ABP)$. We have found that the angles $ABQ$ and $ABP$ each measure 30 degrees so $m(\angle PBQ) = 60$. We also know that $\triangle PBQ$ is isosceles with $\overline{PB} = \overline{QB}$. This is true because reflection about $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ maps $\overline{PB}$ to $\overline{QB}$ and vice versa. Base angles in an isosceles triangle are congruent so</p>

<p>$$ m(\angle BPQ) = m(\angle BQP). $$</p>

<p>We also know that</p>

<p>$$ m(\angle PBQ) + m(\angle BPQ) + m(\angle BQP) = 180. $$</p>

<p>Using the fact that $m(\angle PBQ) = 60$ we find that</p>

<p>$$ m(\angle BPQ) + m(\angle BQP) = 120. $$</p>

<p>Since these two angles are congruent we find that $m(\angle BPQ) = m(\angle BQP) = 60$. Since all three angles in $\triangle PBQ$ are 60 degree angles it is an equilateral triangle. The vertices $P, B, Q$ all lie on the circle so $\triangle PBQ$ is an equilateral triangle inscribed in the given circle. It is pictured below with all of the auxiliary constructions removed:</p>

	<li>It seems reasonable to suppose that the volume of a rectangular pyramid is, like a rectangular prism, proportional to its length $\ell$, width $w$, and height $h$. &nbsp;That is, we expect a formula of the form $$ V=c(\ell wh) $$ for some constant $c$. Find a constant $c$ for which this formula is true for the square pyramid described in the previous parts.</li>
	<li>Does the disection method described in this problem work to find a formula for the volume of an arbitrary pyramid? Why?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the scenario. &nbsp;Note that the congruence of the 6 pyramids can be viewed either dynamically (rotating the cube takes one pyramid onto another) or by calculating that all correpsonding lengths are equal.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/233/large/Pyramid_in_Cube_395485726d46ab8fabecc1085c48d4ca.png?1403105489"" /></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The height of the pyramid is the distance from the peak to its base. &nbsp;Since the&nbsp;peak of the pyramid is the center of the cube, it halfway between any pair of opposite faces of the cube. &nbsp;Since opposite faces of the cube are $\ell$ units apart, the height of the pyramid is $\ell/2$.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Since the 6 identical pyramids perfectly fill the cube, the volume of each pyramid is $\frac{1}{6}$ of the surrounding cube, or $\frac{1}{6}\ell^3$.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For our pyramid, we have $w=\ell$, and $h=\ell/2$, so the formula given in the problem is $V=c(\ell)(\ell)(\ell/2)=\frac{c}{2}\,\ell^3$.&nbsp; For this to match our volume calculation from the previous part, we need to have $c=\frac{1}{3}$.&nbsp; That is, we find that for this particular pyramid, we have the formula $$V=\frac{1}{3}(\ell wh).$$</p>
	</li>
	<li>The method used here is very special to this particular shape of pyramid. First it is vital that the base of the pyramid is a square. Secondly it is vital that the height of the pyramid be half the length of the base sides so that the six pyramids fit together perfectly to make a cube. If the height were smaller or larger they would no longer fit together to make a cube and so some other argument would be needed to calculate the volume.&nbsp;</li>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The number of cubic feet of water that Aquarium A will hold is found by subtracting the volume of the cone from the volume of the cylinder:</p>
	$$ \text{Volume of Cylinder} - \text{Volume of Cone} = \text{Maximum Volume of Water for Aquarium A} $$ $$ \begin{align} \pi \times (\text{radius})^2 \times (\text{height}) - \frac13 \times \pi \times (\text{radius})^2 \times (\text{height}) &amp;= \frac23 \times \pi \times (\text{radius})^2 \times (\text{height}) \\ &amp;= \frac23 \times \pi \times 5^2 \times 5 \\ &amp;= \frac{250\pi}{3} \approx 262 \end{align} $$ so Aquarium A can hold about 262 cubit feet of water.</li>
	<li>
	<p>The area of the water&rsquo;s surface at height $h$ can be derived by examining cross-sections. The radius and height of the cylinder and cone are both 5 feet, so the vertical cross-section through the vertex of the cone shown below shows that the cross section of the water forms an isosceles right triangle:</p>

	<div><img alt=""Sol_1_366bf74e694aa3010c6a47bb08fb8b46"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/375/medium/Sol_1_366bf74e694aa3010c6a47bb08fb8b46.jpg?1329946349"" />
	<p>Therefore, the horizontal distance between the cone and the aquarium wall at height $h$ is also $h$.</p>

	<p>The area of the water&rsquo;s surface at height $h$ is found by subtracting the area of the inner circle, with radius $5 &ndash; h$, from the area of the outer circle, with radius 5.</p>
	</div>

	<p>$$ \text{Area of Outer Circle} - \text{Area of Inner Circle} = \text{Area of Water&rsquo;s Surface at Height h} $$ $$ \begin{align} \pi \times 5^2 - \pi \times (5-h)^2 &amp;= 25\pi - \pi (25-10h+h^2) \\ &amp;= 25\pi - 25\pi + 10 \pi h - \pi h^2) \\ &amp;= 10 \pi h - \pi h^2 \end{align} $$</p>

	<p>When Aquarium A is filled to a height of $h$ feet, the area of the water&rsquo;s surface is $10 \pi h - \pi h^2$ square feet.</p>

	<p>Momentarily, the horizontal distance between the curved wall and the sphere&rsquo;s center at height $h$ is denoted by $x$. But $x$ can be expressed in terms of $h$, since $x$ and $5 &ndash; h$ both represent leg lengths of a right triangle with hypotenuse 5: $$ \begin{align} x^2 + (5 &ndash; h)^2 &amp;= 25 \\ x^2 + 25 &ndash; 10h + h^2 &amp;= 25 \\ x^2 &amp;= 10h &ndash; h^2 \\ x &amp;= \sqrt{10h &ndash; h^2} \end{align} $$</p>

	<p>In this case, the area of the water&rsquo;s surface at height $h$ is simply the area of a circle whose radius is $\sqrt{10h &ndash; h^2}$: $$ \begin{align} \text{Area} &amp;= \pi(\sqrt{10h &ndash; h^2})^2 \\ &amp;= \pi(10h &ndash; h^2) \\ &amp;= 10 \pi h - \pi h^2 \end{align} $$</p>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cavalieri&rsquo;s principle states that two 3-dimensional solids of the same height are equal in volume if the areas of their horizontal cross-sections at every height $h$ are equal. Since both aquariums stand 5 feet tall, and since the area of the water&rsquo;s surface when filled to a height of $h$ feet is the same for each aquarium, the volumes of water must be equal when both aquariums are filled to full capacity according to this principle. Therefore, no further calculations are necessary to determine that Aquarium B will hold $\frac{250 \pi }{3}\approx 262$ cubic feet of water, the very same volume that Aquarium A will hold.</p>

(Solving $x^2+3.5^2=9.1^2$ gives $x=8.4$). Since we leave the top centimeter of the height of the cup empty, the height of the filled portion would then be 7.4cm. Using similar triangles we find that the radius of the filled area is in ratio $7.4:8.4$ to the original radius of 3.5cm, i.e., the radius of the filled region is $\frac{7.4}{8.4}\cdot 3.5=\frac{37}{12}\approx 3.08$ cm. Using the formula for the volume of a cone we find that each cone of water contains approximately $$ \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h=\frac{1}{3}\pi (3.08)^2(7.4)\approx 73.51 $$ cubic centimeters (i.e., millileters) of water. As Jared needs to drink 3000ml of water, dividing $\frac{3000}{73.51}\approx 40.81$ tells us that he needs to drink about 41 cones of water over the course of the day.</p>

	<p>Multiplying the 25 cones by 73.51ml we find that Jared has already drunk 1837.75ml of his required 3 liters, leaving him with 1162.25ml to still drink. We quickly calculating from the volume of a cylinder that each cupful of his drinking glasses can hold approximately $\pi r^2h=\pi(13)(3.5)^2\approx 500$ ml, so he needs to drink just over 2 glasses of water before going to bed.</p>

	<p>The circle of radius 2 with center $(1,1)$ is pictured below. To get a feel for how to apply the Pythagorean theorem in this setting, a point $(1 +\sqrt{2},1 + \sqrt{2})$ has been also been labelled on the circle:</p>

	<p>A third point $(1,1+\sqrt{2})$ has been added, making a right triangle along with the center of the circle and the point $(1+\sqrt{2},1+\sqrt{2})$. The Pythagorean theorem tells us that the sum of the squares of the legs of this triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse: $$ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2^2. $$</p>

	<p>More generally, if $(x,y)$ is any point on the circle of radius 2 centered at $(1,1)$ then this means that the distance from $(x,y)$ to $(1,1)$ is 2. A picture of this situation is given below:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Circleequation2_38ef50809867479806ce84dcae82e68f"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/022/max/circleequation2_38ef50809867479806ce84dcae82e68f.jpg?1363899514"" /></p>

	<p>The lengths of the legs of the triangle are calculated as follows: for the horizontal the length is $|x-1|$ because the distance of two numbers on a line is found by taking the absolute value of their difference. Similarly, the vertical leg has length $|y-1|$. The hypotenuse has length 2 because $(x,y)$ lies on the circle of radius 2 and center $(1,1)$. By the Pythagorean theorem $$ (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 2^2. $$ The absolute value signs are not necessary here because $(x-1)^2 = |x-1|^2$ and $(y-1)^2 = |y-1|^2$. So every point $(x,y)$ on the circle of radius $2$ with center $(1,1)$ satisfies the equation $$ (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 2^2. $$</p>

	<p>Conversely, with the exceptions of $(1,3), (1,-1), (3,1)$, and $(-1,1)$, every pair $(x,y)$ satisfying the equation $$ (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 2^2 $$ gives a triangle as above and a point on the circle with radius $2$ and center $(1,1)$: the Pythagorean theorem tells us that if $(x,y)$ satisfies this equation then it is a distance $2$ from $(1,1)$ and is therefore on the circle of radius $2$ and center $(1,1)$. The four exceptional cases noted above also lie on the circle of radius 2 with center $(1,1)$ but there is no triangle in this case, just a line segment of length 2.</p>

	<p>The lengths of the three sides are found as in part (a) and have been labelled: the hypotenuse is a radius of the circle and so has length $r$ and the lengths of the two legs are found by taking the absolute value of the differences of the $y$ coordinates for the vertical one and the $x$ coordinates for the horizontal leg. By the Pythagorean theorem $$ (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2. $$ The absolute value signs are not necessary here because $(x-a)^2 = |x-a|^2$ and $(y-b)^2 = |y-b|^2$. So every point $(x,y)$ on the circle of radius $r$ with center $(a,b)$ satisfies the equation $$ (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2. $$</p>

	<p>Conversely, with the exceptions of $(a,b+r), (a,b-r), (a-r,b),$ and $(a+r,b)$, every pair $(x,y)$ satisfying the equation $$ (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2 $$ gives a triangle as above and a point on the circle with radius $r$ and center $(a,b)$: the Pythagorean theorem tells us that if $(x,y)$ satisfies this equation then it is a distance $r$ from $(a,b)$ and is therefore on the circle of radius $r$ and center $(a,b)$.

	<li>The point equidistant from $F$ and the $y$-axis is $P_0 = (0,1)$, the bisector of the segment joining $(0,0)$ and $(0,2)$. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>To find the point $P_1$ equidistant from $F$ and the line $x = 1$, we know that $P_1 = (1,y)$ for some number $y$. The distance from $(1,y)$ to $\ell$ is $y$ while its distance from $F$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem: $$\sqrt{1+(y-2)^2}.$$ So we need to solve the equation $$y = \sqrt{1+ (y-2)^2}.$$ Squaring both sides gives $y^2 = 1 + (y-2)^2$ or $-4y + 5 = 0$. So $y = \frac{5}{4}$. This means that $P_1 = \left(1, \frac{5}{4}\right)$.</li>
	<li>To find the point $P_2$ equidistant from $F$ and the line $x = 2$, we know that $P_2 = (2,y)$ for some number $y$. The distance from $(2,y)$ to $\ell$ is $y$ while its distance from $F$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem: $$\sqrt{4+(y-2)^2}.$$ So we need to solve the equation $$y = \sqrt{4+ (y-2)^2}.$$ Squaring both sides gives $y^2 = 4 + (y-2)^2$ or $-4y&nbsp;+ 8 = 0$. So $y = 2$ and $P_2 = \left(2, 2\right).$ In this case, we can readily see that $P_2$ is a distance of 2 from both $F$ and $\ell$.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We can try this procedure with $y = a$. The distance from $(a,y)$ to $\ell$ is $y$ while its distance from $F$ is $$\sqrt{a^2 + (y-2)^2}$$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. Setting these two quantities equal and squaring both sides gives $$y^2 = a^2 + (y-2)^2.$$ After simplifying we find $-4y + a^2 + 4 = 0$ or $y = \frac{a^2 + 4}{4}$.

<p>Below is a picture of the quadrilateral, labelled $PQRS$, with the two diagonals added, along with points $M$ and $N$ which will help to calculate the length of the two diagonals $\overline{PR}$ and $\overline{QS}$ using the Pythagorean theorem.</p>

<p><img alt=""Rectangle1_88d2427499ad8c41ebe68761dd05629f"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/731/max/rectangle1_88d2427499ad8c41ebe68761dd05629f.jpg?1356316364"" /></p>

<p>We can find the lengths of $\overline{PR}$ and $\overline{QS}$ applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangles $PMR$ and $SNQ$.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>\begin{align} |PR|^2 &amp;= |PM|^2 + |MR|^2 \\ |SQ|^2 &amp;= |SN|^2 + |NQ|^2 \end{align}</div>

<p>The lengths on the right can all be calculated by using the coordinates. For example $|PM| = 5$ and $|MR| = 15$ since $P = (-6,2)$, $M = (-6,-3)$, and $R = (9,-3)$. Similarly $|SN| = 13$ and $|NQ| = 9$. Plugging these values into the above equations we find $$ |PR| = |SQ| = \sqrt{250}. $$</p>

<p>To show that $PQRS$ is a rectangle, we need to show that the four angles are right angles. To do this, we use the converse of the Pythagorean theorem which we will apply to triangles in the picture below:</p>

<p><img alt=""Rectangle2_4071fe478beee76a831f1ce857026709"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/732/max/rectangle2_4071fe478beee76a831f1ce857026709.jpg?1356363692"" /></p>

<p>For example to show that angle $PQR$ is a right angle, we will show that $|PR|^2 = |PQ|^2 + |QR|^2$. We already have found $|PR|^2$ above, $|PR|^2 = 250$. To find $|PQ|^2$ we apply the Pythagorean theorem to $\triangle PQF$, a right triangle with hypotenuse $\overline{PQ}$. We have $$ |PQ|^2 = |QF|^2 + |PF|^2. $$ Since $|QF| = 3$ and $|PF| = 4$ we find $|PQ|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$. Similarly to find $|QR|$ we apply the Pythagorean theorem to $\triangle QRG$, a right triangle with hypotenuse $\overline{QR}$. We have $$ |QR|^2 = |QG|^2 + |RG|^2 = 12^2 + 9^2 = 225. $$ Putting together everything we have found we have</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>\begin{align} |PR|^2 &amp;= 250 \\ &amp;= 225 + 25 \\ &amp;= |QR|^2 + |PQ|^2. \end{align}</div>

<p>By the converse of the Pythagorean theorem applied to $\triangle PQR$, $\angle PQR$ is a right angle.</p>

<p>This argument can be repeated four times to show that the other four angles in quadrilateral $PQRS$ are right angles. For example, to show that angle $QRS$ is a right angle, we calculate $|QR|$ applying the Pythagorean theorem to $\triangle QGR$, then we find $|RS|$ applying the Pythagorean theorem to $\triangle RHS$. We found $|SQ|^2$ above and so we can conclude that angle $QRS$ is a right angle by verifying that $|SQ|^2 = |QR|^2 + |RS|^2$.</p>

<p>The goal here is first to translate the quadrilateral so that it is centered at $(0,0)$ and then apply a rotation about $(0,0)$ so that the lines containing the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the grid lines. Notice that $(-3,6)$ is the point of the rectangle with the largest $y$ coordinate while $(6,-7)$ is the point with the smallest $y$ coordinate. The point with the largest $x$ coordinate is $(9,-3)$ while the point with the smallest $x$ coordinate is $(-6,2)$. We need to translate to the left by $1.5$ units and up by $0.5$ units to center this rectangle around $(0,0)$. The vertices of the translated rectangle are $(-7.5,2.5)$, $(-4.5,6.5)$, $(7.5,-2.5)$, $(4.5,-6.5)$. The translated rectangle, with vertices $A = (-7.5,2.5)$, $B = (-4.5,6.5)$, $C = (7.5,-2.5)$, $D = (4.5,-6.5)$ is pictured below:</p>

<p><img alt=""Rectangle3_6251c01a431be0d2dc49f4df808f1063"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/733/max/rectangle3_6251c01a431be0d2dc49f4df808f1063.jpg?1356375928"" /></p>

<p>Notice that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram: we can see this by computing the slopes of the lines containing opposite sides of the parallelogram. For example $$ \text{slope}\left(\overleftrightarrow{AB}\right) = \frac{2.5-6.5}{-7.5 -(-4.5)} = \frac{-2.5-(-6.5)}{7.5 - 4.5} = \text{slope}\left( \overleftrightarrow{CD}\right) $$ which we can see without evaluating as the right hand expression is the left hand expression multiplied by $\frac{-1}{-1} = 1$. Similarly $$ \text{slope}\left(\overleftrightarrow{BC}\right) = \frac{6.5-(-2.5)}{-4.5-7.5} = \frac{-6.5-2.5}{4.5-(-7.5)} = \text{slope}\left(\overleftrightarrow{DA}\right). $$ Notice that the diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ of quadrilateral $ABCD$ both pass through $(0,0)$. This is because the coordinates of $C$ are opposite the coordinates of $A$ and similarly for $B$ and $D$. The diagonals of $ABCD$ are also congruent as can be seen, for example by applying the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from $(0,0)$ to $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. For example, the distance from $A$ to $(0,0)$ is $\sqrt{7.5^2 + 2.5^2}$. This is the same as $\sqrt{4.5^2 + 6.5^2}$ which is the distance from $B$ to $(0,0)$.</p>

<p>Suppose we rotate $ABCD$ about $(0,0)$ until we find a new quadrilateral $EFGH$ with $\overleftrightarrow{FG}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{EH}$ both parallel to the $x$-axis. The diagonals $\overline{EG}$ and $\overline {FH}$ still meet at $(0,0)$ and are congruent as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt=""Rectangle5_7c4623860cfa092fa6f26e07e37dd63d"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/735/max/rectangle5_7c4623860cfa092fa6f26e07e37dd63d.jpg?1356381593"" /></p>

<p>Looking at the picture, suppose we fix $E$ and $G$ and then choose $x$ and $y$ with $x$ on the upper blue line, $y$ on the lower blue line so that $(0,0)$ is contained in $\overline{xy}$. If $x$ is to the left of $F$ or to the right of $G$, then $|xy| \gt |EG|$. If $x$ is between $F$ and $G$ then $|xy| \lt |EG|$. So if $|xy| = |EG|$ then $x = F, y = H$ where $EFGH$ is a rectangle.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Slopes of lines (G.GPE.4 and G.GPE.5) </span></p>

<p>We label the vertices of the quadrilateral as follows: $P = (-6,2)$, $Q = (-3,6)$, $R = (9,-3)$, $S = (6,-7)$:</p>

<p><img alt=""Recdtangle6_e669f589bd1f9807f7d3512fa2002542"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/736/max/recdtangle6_e669f589bd1f9807f7d3512fa2002542.jpg?1356391981"" /></p>

<p>The idea of this approach is to consider the lines containing the four sides of quadrilateral $PQRS$ and show, using the slope criterion, that they meet in right angles. Recall that the slope criterion says that if line $L_1$ has slope $s_1 \neq 0$ and line $L_2$ has slope $s_2 = \frac{-1}{s_1}$ then $L_1$ and $L_2$ are perpendicular (at the single point where they meet). We calculate the slopes of the lines containing adjacent vertices of $PQRS$:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>\begin{align} \text{slope}\left(\overleftrightarrow{PQ}\right) &amp;= \frac{2-6}{-6-(-3)} = \frac{-4}{-3}\\ \text{slope}\left(\overleftrightarrow{QR}\right) &amp;= \frac{6-(-3)}{-3-9} = \frac{9}{-12} \\ \text{slope}\left(\overleftrightarrow{RS}\right) &amp;= \frac{-3-(-7)}{9-6} = \frac{4}{3} \\ \text{slope}\left(\overleftrightarrow{SP}\right) &amp;= \frac{-7-2}{6-(-6)} = \frac{-9}{12} \end{align}</div>

<p>Since $\frac{-4}{-3}$ and $\frac{9}{-12}$ are reciprocals of opposite signs, $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$ meets $\overleftrightarrow{QR}$ perpendicularly at $Q$. Since $\frac{9}{-12}$ and $\frac{4}{3}$ are reciprocals of opposite signs, $\overleftrightarrow{QR}$ meets $\overleftrightarrow{RS}$ perpendicularly at $R$. Since $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\frac{-9}{12}$ are reciprocals of opposite signs, $\overleftrightarrow{RS}$ meets $\overleftrightarrow{SP}$ perpendicularly at $S$. Since $\frac{-9}{12}$ and $\frac{-4}{-3}$ are reciprocals of opposite signs, $\overleftrightarrow{SP}$ meets $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$ perpendicularly at $P$. Since all four angles in quadrilateral $PQRS$ are right angles, $PQRS$ is a rectangle.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Similar triangles (G.SRT.5) </span></p>

<p>This approach begins by adding a rectangle, whose sides lie on the coordinate gridlines, in which the given rectangle is inscribed as pictured below:</p>

<p><img alt=""Rectangle4_331b48df2763cfc439728f567761708b"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/734/max/rectangle4_331b48df2763cfc439728f567761708b.jpg?1356379509"" /></p>

<p>The given quadrilateral has been labelled $PQRS$ and the circumscribing rectangle has been labelled $ABCD$. We will now study the following four triangles: $\triangle APS$, $\triangle BQP$, $\triangle CRQ$, and $\triangle DSR$. Observe that $\triangle APS$ is congruent to $\triangle CRQ$ by SAS:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>$|AP| = |CR| = 9$,</li>
	<li>$|AS| = |CQ| = 12$,</li>
	<li>$m(\angle A) = m(\angle C) = 90$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar reasoning shows that $\triangle BQP$ is congruent to $\triangle DSR$:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>$|BQ| = |DS| = 3$,</li>
	<li>$|BP| = |DR| = 4$,</li>
	<li>$m(\angle B) = m(\angle D) = 90$.</li>
</ul>

<p>We now compare one triangle from each of our congruent pairs, $\triangle APS$ and $\triangle BQP$ for example. Notice that $|AP| = 3 \times |BQ|$ and $|AS| = 3 \times |BP|$. Since angles $A$ and $B$ are both right angles it follows that $\triangle APS$ is similar to $\triangle BQP$. If students are not familiar with this SAS version of similarity for triangles, they may also use the Pythagorean theorem to find that $$ |PS|^2 = |AP|^2 + |AS|^2 $$ and, plugging in $|AP| = 9$ and $|AS| = 12$ this gives $|PQ| = 15$. By the same reasoning $$ |QP|^2 = |BQ|^2 + |BP|^2 $$ and, plugging in $|BQ| = 3$ and $|BP| = 4$ this gives $|PQ| = 5$. Thus $|PS| = 3 \times |PQ|$ and so the three sides of $\triangle APS$ are each three times the length of the corresponding sides of $\triangle BQP$. It follows that $\triangle APS$ and $\triangle BQP$ are similar and these are both, in turn, similar to $\triangle CRQ$ and $\triangle DQR$.</p>

<p>We can now use the similarity of triangles above and the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$ to show that each angle in quadrilateral $PQRS$ is a right angle. We provide a detailed argument for $\angle QPS$; the other cases can be done in the same way. Note that $$ m(\angle BPQ) + m(\angle (QPS) + m(\angle APS) = 180 $$ because these three angles combined make a straight line. Since $\triangle APS$ is similar to $\triangle BQP$ we know that $m(\angle BPQ) = m(\angle ASP)$. We have $m(\angle APS) + m(\angle ASP) + m(\angle PAS) = 180$. But $m(\angle PAS) = 90$ since this angle is formed by the intersection of $x$ and $y$ coordinate axes. So we conclude that</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>\begin{align} m(\angle (QPS) &amp;= 180 - m(\angle APS) - m(\angle BPQ) \\ &amp;= 180 -m(\angle APS) + m(\angle ASP) \\ &amp;= 180 - 90 \\ &amp; = 90. \end{align}</div>

<p>A similar argument shows that the other four angles in quadrilateral $PQRS$ are right angles and so it is a rectangle.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Congruent Triangles (G-CO.9, G-CO.11) </span></p>

<p>This solution is a variant of the first solution appropriate for high school students. Each of the two diagonals of the rectangle cuts the rectangle into two triangles and we will show using the $SSS$ criterion for triangle congruence that all four of these triangles are congruent. This means that all four triangle are right triangles and that the quadrilateral is a rectangle.</p>

<p><img alt=""Rectangle7_4099f720638acfc714fb22df947d1192"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/738/max/rectangle7_4099f720638acfc714fb22df947d1192.jpg?1356455159"" /></p>

<p>Using the coordinates $P = (-6,2)$, $Q = (-3,6)$, $R = (9,-3)$, $S = (6,-7)$ and the distance formula for points in the plane we have</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>\begin{align} |PQ| &amp;= \sqrt{25} = 5\\ |QR| &amp;= \sqrt{225} = 15\\ |RS| &amp;= \sqrt{25} = 5\\ |SP| &amp;= \sqrt{225} = 15. \end{align}</div>

<p>As in the first solution, the length of the two diagonals can also be found using the Pythagorean theorem for distance:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>\begin{align} |QS| &amp;= \sqrt{250} \\ |PR| &amp;= \sqrt{250}. \end{align}</div>

<p>Using this information and the SSS criterion for triangle congruence we see that $\triangle PSQ$, $\triangle SPR$, $\triangle RQS$, and $\triangle QRP$ are all congruent. Since the sum of the four angles of quadrilateral $PQRS$ is $360^\circ$ and these four angles are all congruent, they must each measure $90^\circ$ and $PQRS$ is a rectangle.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Parallelograms and rectangles (G-CO.11) </span></p>

<p>This solution follows the same logic as the second solution but uses the important criterion for a rectangle developed in high school: a parallelogram is a rectangle if and only if it has congruent diagonals. We first show that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. The slope of the line containing $(-6, 2)$ and $(-3,6)$ is $$ \frac{6-2}{-3-(-6)} = \frac{4}{3}. $$ The slope of the line containing $(9, -3)$ and $(6,-7)$ is $$ \frac{-7-(-3)}{6-9} = \frac{-4}{-3}. $$ Since these lines have the same slope, they are parallel. Similarly, the slope of the line containing $(-6,2)$ and $(6,-7)$ is $$ \frac{-7-2}{6-(-6)} = \frac{-9}{12}. $$ The slope of the lines containing $(-3,6)$ and $(9,-3)$ is $$ \frac{-3-6}{9-(-3)} = \frac{-9}{12}. $$ These two lines have the same slope and so they are also parallel and the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.</p>

<p>To show that the two diagonals of the quadrilateral have the same length, we can use the distance formula for points in the plane. The distance from $(-6,2)$ to $(9,-3)$ is $$ \sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + ((-3)-2)^2} = \sqrt{250}. $$ The distance from $(6,-7)$ to $(-3,6)$ is $$ \sqrt{(-3-6)^2 + (6-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{250}. $$ These two diagonals of the parallelogram have the same length and so the quadrilateral formed by these four points is a rectangle.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>In order for slope($\ell$) and slope($m$) to be well-defined, neither of the lines can be vertical. Assuming that $\ell$ and $m$ are not vertical, we can define $\ell$ by a linear function $y = m_1x + b_1$ and $m$ by a linear function $y = m_2x + b_2$. Since $\ell$ and $m$ are distinct and parallel they share no common points. So $y = m_1x + b_1$ and $y = m_2x + b_2$ have no common solutions. Setting them equal and manipulating we find $$ (m_1-m_2)x = b_2 - b_1. $$ This equation can be solved (giving the $x$-coordinate of a point in common to $\ell$ and $m$) unless $m_1 = m_2$, that is unless the slopes of $\ell$ and $m$ are the same. Thus for any pair of non-vertical parallel lines $\ell$ and $m$, we have slope($\ell$) = slope($m$).</p>

	<p>From a geometric perspective, we can explain why two lines with different slope intersect and hence why two parallel lines must have the same slope. &nbsp;One way to see this is to apply a rotation of the plane so that one of our lines maps to&nbsp;the $x$-axis and the other line maps to a line with non-zero slope. All lines with non-zero slope (and all vertical lines) cross the $x$-axis exactly once. &nbsp;We conclude that lines with different slope must meet and so if $\ell$ and $m$ are parallel then they must have the same slope or both be vertical.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>As in part (a) we can define $\ell$ by a linear function $y = m_1x + b_1$ and $m$ by a linear function $y = m_2x + b_2$. By hypothesis $m_1 = m_2$. This means that $b_1 \neq b_2$ since $\ell$ and $m$ are distinct. The lines are parallel because $y = m_1x + b_1$ and $y = m_2x + b_2$ have no common solution: as above, setting the two equations equal gives $(m_1 - m_2)x = b_2 - b_1$. This is equivalent to $0x = b_2 - b_1$ which is not possible because $b_2 \neq b_1$.</p>

	<p>From a geometric perspective, lines with the same slope can be viewed as vertical translations of one another. For example, suppose we want to look at all lines with slope 2. We have the line defined by the equation $y = 2x$ which passes through the origin. For each real number $b$ we can displace this line vertically by $b$, producing the line defined by the equation $y = 2x + b$. A line and one of its vertical displacements do not meet and so they are parallel.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Similar Triangles </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>One possibility is that $\ell$ and $m$ have no well-defined slope and are parallel vertical lines.&nbsp;If $\ell$ and $m$ are parallel horizontal lines then slope($\ell$) and slope($m$) are both 0. We now focus on the case where $\ell$ and $m$ are parallel lines which are neither vertical nor horizontal.</p>

	<p>Since $\ell$ and $m$ are neither horizontal nor vertical, they both intersect the $x$-axis and they also both intersect the $y$-axis. These intersection points are labeled in the picture below:</p>

	<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/123/medium/b1_96140ed4b7561c0eafaf105d46513a3a.jpg?1397338737"" /></p>

	<p>We know that $m(\angle OAB) = m(\angle OCD)$ because $\ell$ and $m$ are parallel and the $y$-axis is a transverse to these parallel lines. Triangles $ABO$ and $CDO$ share right angle $O$ and we can conclude that they are similar. Since corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional we have $$\frac{|AO|}{|BO|} = \frac{|CO|}{|DO|}.$$ This means that slope($\ell$) = slope($m$).</p>
	</li>
	<li>If slope($\ell$) = slope($m$) = 0 then both $\ell$ and $m$ are horizontal and are therefore parallel. So we may assume that slope($\ell$) = slope($m$) and that this common value is not 0. This means that $\ell$ and $m$ intersect both the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis as in the picture above for part (a). The reasoning for part (a) can now be run through in reverse. Since slope($\ell$) = slope($m$) this means that&nbsp;$$\frac{|AO|}{|BO|} = \frac{|CO|}{|DO|}.$$ Since $\triangle AOB$ and $\triangle COD$ are both right triangles they are similar. Thus $m(\angle OAB) = m(\angle OCD)$ since they are corresponding angles in similar triangles. This means that $\ell$ and $m$ are parallel.</li>

	<p>Since $A$ is the center of the dilation, it does not move and we will have $A^\prime = A$. For vertex $B$, we know that $B^\prime$ will lie on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ because dilations preserve lines through the center of dilation. Since the scale factor is $\frac{1}{3}$ we know that $|AB^\prime| = \frac{1}{3}|AB|$. From $A$ to $B$ is 4 units to the right and one unit up. Therefore, one third of the way from $A$ to $B$ (along $\overline{AB}$) will be the point $B^\prime = \left(1+ \frac{4}{3}, 1 + \frac{1}{3}\right)$. Applying this technique to $C$ which is 2 units to the right and 4 units up from $A$, we find $$ C^\prime = \left(1\frac{2}{3}, 2\frac{1}{3} \right). $$</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For $n = 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10$ there are squares of area $n$ units$^2$. The easiest squares to visualize are those having areas of $1, 4,$ and $9$ units$^2$:</p>

<p>The last diagram shows a square of area 10 units$^2$:</p>

<p><img alt=""Sq3_90486436774af40c05a71e7271bd8d2f"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/814/large/sq3_90486436774af40c05a71e7271bd8d2f.jpg?1383514377"" /></p>

<p>We will first explain why the oblique squares have the desired areas and then work on showing that they are squares. The different cases are similar so we focus on the diagram above with the square of area 10 units$^2$. We first choose a pair of adjacent vertices (2,2) and (3,5). According to the Pythagorean Theorem the length of this side is $$ \sqrt{(2-3)^2 + (2-5)^2} = \sqrt{10} \text{ units}. $$ We can check similarly that all of the other sides have length $\sqrt{10}$ units and so, assuming the shape is a square, its area is 10 units$^2$ as desired. A similar argument will work for each of the other figures.</p>

<p>For the angles, the side joining (2,2) to (5,1) has slope $$ \frac{2-1}{2-5} = -\frac{1}{3}. $$ The side joining (5,1) to (6,4) has slope $$ \frac{1-4}{5-6} = 3. $$ These slopes have a product of $-1$ and so the two lines containing these segments are perpendicular. Similar calculations show that the other angles in this quadrilateral are right angles and so it is a square.</p>

<p>A second way to show that these are squares is to use the fact that a square is a quadrilateral which is both a rectangle and a rhombus and then use properties of rectangles and rhombi. For example, a square is a rhombus whose diagonals are congruent. Working with the last quadrilateral again (which we have shown to be a rhombus by calculating its side lengths), the diagonal joining (2,2) to (6,4) has length $$ \sqrt{(6-2)^2+(4-2)^2} = \sqrt{20} \text{ units}. $$ The other diagonal joining (3,5) and (5,1) has length $$ \sqrt{(3-5)^2 + (5-1)^2} = \sqrt{20} \text{ units}. $$ The two diagonals of the rhombus are congruent and so it is a square. Similar calculations can be made for any of the other squares. Alternatively, a square is a rectangle whose diagonals are perpendicular. We have seen how to show that the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Its diagonals have slopes of $-2$ and $\frac{1}{2}$. Since the product of these slopes is $-1$, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the quadrilateral is a square.</p>

<p>Lastly, we need to explain why there are no squares of area 3, 6, and 7 units$^{2}$ whose vertices lie at grid points. Suppose $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_2,b_2)$ are vertices of a side of a square. Then the length of that side is $$ \sqrt{(a_2-a_1)^2 + (b_2-b_1)^2} \text{ units}^2 $$ and so the area of the square can be written as a sum of squares: $$ (a_2-a_1)^2 + (b_2-b_1)^2 \text{ units}^2. $$ If the vertices of the square lie on grid points then $a_2 - a_1$ and $b_2 - b_1$ are integers. We can then check that 3, 6, and 7 cannot be written as sums of squares of integers and so there are no squares with these areas whose vertices lie on grid points.</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: Decomposition of hexagon into triangles </span></p>

<p>a. We find the area of the hexagon by decomposing it into $6$ congruent equilateral pictures as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt=""Regularhexagon2_9afe5aa4690b70b4b6db7053a306b6eb"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/403/max/regularhexagon2_9afe5aa4690b70b4b6db7053a306b6eb.jpg?1346263113"" /></p>

<p>From the picture we have that the area of the hexagon with side length $s$ is $6$ times the area of the equilateral triangle with side length $s$.</p>

<p>The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$. An argument for this calculation is provided here focusing on triangle $ABO$ from the hexagon picture. In order to use the formula, Area = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ Base $\times$ Height for a triangle, we need to choose a base and then determine the height of the triangle with this base:</p>

<p><img alt=""Hexratio1_36cf0c6bb2ffaf7f548c9661da325c79"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/579/max/hexratio1_36cf0c6bb2ffaf7f548c9661da325c79.jpg?1349643645"" /></p>

<p>Triangles $AMC$ and $BMC$ are congruent as we can see using using $SSS$:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that $|AB| = s$. To find $|MC|$ note that since triangles $AMC$ and $BMC$ are congruent this means that angles $AMC$ and $BMC$ are congruent. Since angles $AMC$ and $BMC$ are supplementary, this means that they are both right angles. So we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $AMC$ to find $|MC|$: $$ |MC|^2 + |AM|^2 = |AC|^2. $$ We know that $|AC| = s$ since $AC$ is congruent to $AB$. We also know that $AM$ is congruent to $BM$ and, since $|AM| + |BM| = |AB| = s$, this means that $|AM| = \frac{s}{2}$. Plugging into the formula above we get $$ |MC|^2 + \frac{s^2}{4} = s^2. $$ So $|MC|^2 = \frac{3s^2}{4}$ and $$ |MC| = \frac{\sqrt{3}s}{2}. $$ Now we have found the height of triangle $ABC$ and so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $$ \frac{1}{2}\times s \times \frac{\sqrt{3}s}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}s^2}{4}. $$</p>

<p>The area of the hexagon is $6$ times the area of the equilateral triangle and so the area of the regular hexagon is $\frac{3 \sqrt{3}s^2}{2}$.</p>

<ul>
	<li>$AM$ is congruent to $BM$ since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$,</li>
	<li>$AC$ is congruent to $BC$ because triangle $ABC$ is equilaterial,</li>
	<li>$MC$ is congruent to $MC$.</li>
</ul>

<p>b. The ratio of area to perimeter for a regular hexagon with side length $s$ is $\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{2}:6s\right)$ which is equivalent to $$ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}s}{4}:1\right). $$ For an equilateral triangle, the corresponding ratio is $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}s^2}{4}:3s\right)$ which is equivalent $$ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}s}{12}:1\right). $$ So the ratio of perimeter to area for the hexagon with side length $s$ is $3$ times as large as the ratio of side length of area for the equilateral triangle with side length $s$. Interestingly we could make this comparison of <em> ratios </em> of area to perimeter without calculating any areas. Once the side length $s$ is fixed the area of the hexagon with side length $s$ is $6$ times the area of the equilateral triangle with side length $s$. The perimeter of the hexagon is twice the perimeter of the equilateral triangle so the ratio of area to perimeter to area is three times greater for the hexagon compared to the triangle.</p>

<p>For a square with side length $s$, the perimeter is $4s$ while the area is $s^2$ so this gives a ratio of $$ \left(\frac{s}{4}:1\right) $$ for the area to the perimeter. So the area to perimeter ratio of the regular hexagon is $\sqrt{3}$ times as large as the corresponding ratio for squares.</p>

<p>c. There are several advantages to building a beehive in this way, tiling the plane with regular polygons. First, the walls in the construction are all simple and since the walls are all the same size the process of constructing the hive is repetitive and straightforward. Next, one big advantage to a tiling like this is that each wall serves as a wall to <em> two </em> distinct chambers, doubling the amount of useable space created with the given materials: this is the same for triangles, squares, and hexagons and does not privilege one over the others. As far as the choice between triangles, squares, and hexagons, the mathematical argument provided here shows that a hexagonal hive produces more useable space with the same amount of materials. Since it requires a lot of work to construct these hives, efficiency would dictate that the bees should make the most of their building materials.</p>

<p><img alt=""Hexagon6_210916fc161d018a8f15265635cb603b"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/586/max/hexagon6_210916fc161d018a8f15265635cb603b.jpg?1349920061"" /></p>

<p>We claim that triangles $AFM$ and $EFM$ are congruent. Segments $EM$ and $AM$ are congruent because $M$ is the midpoint of segment $AE$. Segments $AF$ and $EF$ are congruent because $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon. Segment $FM$ is congruent to itself. So by SSS triangles $AFM$ and $EFM$ are congruent. So $m(\angle AFM) = m(\angle EFM)$. Since $m(\angle AFM) + m(\angle EFM) = m(\angle (AFE)$ and $m(\angle AFE) = 120$ we conclude that $$ m(\angle AFM) = m(\angle EFM) = 60. $$</p>

<p>Angles $AMF$ and $EMF$ are congruent and supplementary so they must both be right angles. Since the sum of the three angles in a triangle is $180$ degrees we must have $$ m(\angle FEM) = m(\angle FAM) = 30. $$ We can apply the same arguments to conclude that $$ m(\angle DCN) = m(\angle BCN) = 60. $$ and $$ m(\angle CDN) = m(\angle CBN) = 30. $$</p>

<p>Angles $FED$, $EDC$, $CBA$, and $BAF$ are all interior angles of a regular hexagon so they all are $120^\circ$ angles. From this and the $30^\circ$ angles calculated above, we find that $$ m(\angle BAE) = m(\angle AED) = m(\angle EDB) = m(\angle DBA) = 90 $$ and so quadrilateral $ABDE$ is rectangle.</p>

<p>We now find the lengths of segments $AM$ and $FM$ and will use this to find the area of the regular hexagon. Side $AF$ has length $s$ by hypothesis. We have $$ \sin{\angle FAM} = \frac{|FM|}{|FA|}. $$ Since $m(\angle FAM) = 30$ and $\sin{30} = \frac{1}{2}$ we conclude that $|FM| = \frac{s}{2}$. Similarly $$ \cos{\angle FAM} = \frac{|AM|}{|FA|}. $$ Since $m(\angle FAM) = 30$ and $\cos{30} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ we conclude that $|FM| = \frac{\sqrt{3}s}{2}$. So</p>

<div>\begin{array} \mbox{\rm Area}(\Delta AFM) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{s}{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}s}{2}\\ &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{3}s^2}{8}. \end{array} The same calculation applies to triangles $EFM$, $DCN$, and $BCN$. Rectangle $ABDE$ has side lengths $|AB| = s$ and $|AE| = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}s}{2}$ so the area of rectangle $ABDE$ is $\sqrt{3}s^2$. Adding up the rectangle and four small triangles we find that the area of the hexagon $ABCDEF$ is $s^2 \times \sqrt{3} \times \frac{3}{2}$.</div>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>About how many cells are in the human body?</p>

<p>You can assume that a cell is a sphere with radius 10$^{-3}$cm and that the density of a cell is approximately the density of water which is 1g/cm$^3$.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, assume that a cell is roughly a sphere with radius 10$^{-3}$cm. Let&#39;s compute the volume of the cell from the relation between radius and volume:</p>

<p>The volume $V$ of a sphere with radius $r$ is $$ V=\frac{4\pi}{3} r^3 $$ where $r^3$ and $V$ have the same units. The volume of a cell with radius 10$^{-3}$cm is therefore $$ V = \frac{4\pi}{3}(10^{-3})^3 \approx 4.1888 \times 10^{-9} \text{ cm}^3 \;.$$</p>

<p>Next, we use the fact that the density of a cell is approximately the density of water which is 1g/cm$^3$. Let&#39;s compute the mass of a cell from its volume and density using the definition of density:</p>

<p>$$ \text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}$$</p>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$ \text{mass} = \text{density} \times \text{volume} \;.$$</p>

<p>The mass of a cell is therefore $$ 1 \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3} \times 4.1888 \times 10^{-9} \text{cm}^3 \approx 4.1888 \times 10^{-9} \text{g} \;.$$</p>

<p>Now you know the mass of a cell, what other piece of information do you need to work out the number of cells in your body? Your mass in grams (if you know your weight in pounds, you can convert: $1\text{ lb} \approx 453.6\text{ grams}$). $$ \text{Number of cells} = \frac{\text{Your Mass}}{\text{Mass of Cell}} $$ For example, the mass of a 100 lb child is about 45,360 grams. We have that</p>

<p>$$ \frac{45,360\;\text{g}}{4.1888 \times 10^{-9}\;\text{g}} \approx 1.0829 \times 10^{13}$$</p>

<p>so there are approximately $1 \times 10^{13} = 10,000,000,000,000$ or ten trillion cells in the human body!</p>

<p><strong>Part (b) Basic Level Responses</strong></p>

<p><em>Develop Equation:</em></p>

<p>Students could divide the lateral surface of the cone into several triangles (with slightly curved bases) by extending line segments from the apex of the cone to the circular base of the cone. Using the area of a triangle formula and the circumference formula, students can determine a formula for the surface area of the cone.</p>

<p>Area of Triangle: $A = \frac12bh$<br />
Circumference: $C = 2\pi r$</p>

<p><img alt=""Gmg.3_ice_cream_clon_0ea96ea77e7996a7b215663c80001338"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/165/large/GMG.3_Ice_Cream_Clon_0ea96ea77e7996a7b215663c80001338.jpg?1326758748"" /></p>

<p>If we label the bases of the triangles by $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, $b_4$, and so on, then the lateral surface area of the cone is the sum of the areas of the triangles: $$\frac12 b_1 h + \frac12 b_2 h + \frac12 b_3 h + \frac12 b_4 h + \dots$$ Factoring out a $\frac{1}{2}h$ from each term, we find that the lateral surface area is given by the formula $$ \frac{1}{2}h(\text{sum of the lengths of the bases)}. $$ The sum of the lengths of the bases is (to a level of accuracy determined by how many triangles you take) just the circumference of the lid cover. Therefore, we conclude that $$ SA\text{(cone)} = \frac12 h (2\pi r)=\pi rh$$<br />
Finally, we observe that the height $h$ of each triangle is precisely the slant height $s$ of the cone, so we can slightly re-write this formula as $SA\text{(cone)} = \pi rs$.</p>

<p>Since the area of the circular lid is given simply by $SA(\text{lid}) = \pi r^2$, the sum of these two formulas is the total surface area of wrapper required for a cone with length of radius of base $r$, and slant height $s$:</p>

<p><em>Maximum Number of Complete Wrappers cut from a 100 cm by 150 cm piece of paper<br />
Metric Units</em></p>

<p>Students working with metric measurements throughout the solution path will not need to convert the dimensions of the paper. This is a stacking problem. Physical models of the templates for the complete wrapper and the rectangular piece of paper are helpful for students that tend to be visual learners. Some students may prefer to use graph paper to construct scale models. When available, drawing software can be useful and time saving.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Misconceptions:</strong><br />
A common misconception is when students ignore the stacking component in this task. Some students simply divide the area of the paper by the area of one complete wrapper. This method does not account for the shapes of the conic wrapper or the circular lid cover. Using this method will yield an answer that is not realistic. An example of this is as follows.</p>

<p>Area of rectangular paper<br />
$A = (\text{length})(\text{width})$<br />
$A = (100)(150)$<br />
$A = 15,000 \text{cm}^2$</p>

<p>$\frac{15000}{110}$ = $136$</p>

<p>Another flawed solution path results when students attempt to stack an incorrect representation of the conic template as shown previously in <strong>Part (a) Solution I (Basic Level Response)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution Paths:</strong><br />
One solution path is to reshape the conic and circular wrapper so it will fit onto a rectangular template by doubling the length of the radius in each shape. Using the dimensions of the square templates, students will determine the number of squares that fit in the rectangular template. This method does not produce the maximum number and results in too much waste. Only 24 complete wrappers can fit onto the rectangular piece of paper using these dimensions. Metric units are used to model following the solution path.</p>

<p>$(2)(2.5 \text{ cm}) = 5 \text{ cm}$<br />
$(2)(11.5 \text{ cm}) = 23 \text{ cm}$</p>

<p>An alternative solution path similar to the last method is to use an elongated rectangular conic template, rather than a square. The dimensions of the rectangle used will depend on the students approach. Some students may use the Pythagorean Theorem to approximate the length of the rectangle because an 80&deg; angle is close to a 90&deg; angle. In this case, the length of the rectangular template will be larger than needed and create additional wasted space when fitted onto the rectangular piece of paper. This method does not produce the maximum number and results in too much waste. Only 64 complete wrappers can fit onto the rectangular piece of paper using these dimensions. Metric units are used to model the following solution path.</p>

	<li>In the picture, it appears that A&#39;B&#39; = 2AB, and B&#39;C&#39; = 2BC. We can obtain more evidence for this guess by measuring the lengths of the segments in our picture.</li>
	<li>We will prove that A&#39;B&#39; = 2AB; the proof that B&#39;C&#39; = 2BC is similar. Note that we will prove this fact without using our unproven conjecture that the dilation of line l is a line parallel to l. (Note to teacher: Allowing students to use this fact makes this proof an easier, but still very worthwhile, classroom exercise.)<br />
	<br />
	We begin by drawing a line through A parallel to line PB, and a line through B parallel to line PA. Let these lines meet at X. Note that we do not yet know that X is on the line A&#39;B&#39;; we will show this in our proof.<br />

	<br />
	Since PAXB is a parallelogram, we know that AX = PB, BX = PA, and angle AXB is congruent to angle BPA.<br />
	<br />
	Now we turn our attention to triangle AA&#39;X. We know that angle A&#39;AX is congruent to angle APB since lines AX and PB are parallel. We also know that AA&#39; = PA, and AX = PB, so by SAS congruence, triangle AA&#39;X is congruent to triangle PAB. Thus the angle AXA&#39; is congruent to angle PBA. A similar argument shows that triangle BXB&#39; is congruent to triangle PAB, and therefore angle BXB&#39; is congruent to angle PAB.<br />
	<br />
	Now we know that $$ m\angle A&#39;XA + m\angle AXB + m\angle BXB&#39; = m\angle PAB + m\angle APB + m\angle PBA = 180^\circ. $$ Thus the angle $\angle A&#39;XB&#39;$ is a straight angle, and we now know that X lies on the line A&#39;B&#39;.<br />
	<br />
	The congruence of triangles PAB, AA&#39;X, and BXB&#39; shows that AB = A&#39;X = XB&#39;. Since X lies on line A&#39;B&#39;, we know that A&#39;B&#39; = A&#39;X + XB&#39; = AB + AB = 2AB. This is what we wanted to show.</li>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. There are many ways to show the congruence between $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$. One method is to first translate $A$ to $D$. This is shown below and the translated triangle is denoted $A^\prime B^\prime C^\prime$.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/196/large/g4_ccea9395984ecf35904473af7b819457.jpg?1400021898"" /></p>

<p>We know that $|AB| = |A^\prime B^\prime| = |DE|$ since rigid motions preserve distances between points. Next we would like to move $B^\prime$ to $E$ which we can do via a rotation through $\angle B^\prime DE$. This is shown below with the rotated triangle marked $A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime}$.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/197/large/g5_ae73dffa9d72b8b4ea94015ec3d1c046.jpg?1400023389"" /></p>

<p>We know that $|DE| = |AB| = |A^\prime B^\prime| = |A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}|$ since rigid motions preserve distances between points. Since $\overrightarrow{A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}} = \overrightarrow{DE}$ and $A^{\prime \prime} = D$ we conclude that $E = B^{\prime \prime}$ as shown in the picture above. Finally we can apply a reflection about $\overleftrightarrow{DE}$. This reflection maps $\overrightarrow{DC^{\prime \prime}}$ to $\overrightarrow{DF}$ because $m(\angle EDF) = m(\angle BAC) = m(\angle B^{\prime \prime}A^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime})$. Similarly, the reflection maps $\overrightarrow{EC^{\prime \prime}}$ to $\overrightarrow{EF}$ because $m(\angle DEF) = m(\angle ABC) = m(\angle A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime})$. This means that reflection over $\overleftrightarrow{DE}$ maps $C^{\prime \prime}$ to $F$ and shows the congruence between $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$.</p>

<p>b.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Melissa is correct that $m(\angle C) = m(\angle F)$<br />
	because $$m(\angle C) = 180 - m(\angle A) - m(\angle B) = 180 - m(\angle D) - m(\angle E) = m(\angle F).$$</li>
	<li>Two triangles sharing three pairs of congruent angles are similar but not necessarily congruent. For example, an equilateral triangle with side lengths 1 is not congrunt to an equilateral triangle with side lengths 2. They are similar, however, with a scale factor of 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>c. If we dilate $\triangle PQR$ with center $P$ by a scale factor of $\frac{|TU|}{|PQ|}$, we know that $P$ does not move and the image $Q^\prime$ of $Q$ will satisfy</p>

<p>$$|PQ^\prime| =&nbsp;\frac{|TU|}{|PQ|}.$$</p>

<p>In particular, we have $|PQ^\prime| = |TU|$. This is pictured below:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/003/198/large/g6_6b46f94f628ee6c5c752bc05ec684290.jpg?1400024767"" /></p>

<p>Dilations preserve lines through the center of the dilation so $Q^\prime$ lies on $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$. Dilations also preserve angles so $m(\angle P^\prime Q^\prime R^\prime) = m(\angle PQR)$ and $m(\angle P^\prime R^\prime Q^\prime) = m(\angle PRQ)$. This means that $\triangle P^\prime Q^\prime R^\prime$ is congruent to $\triangle TUV$ by ASA. Concretely in terms of transformations, we can translate $P$ to $T$ and then a rotation as in part (a) completes the congruence as the two triangles $P^\prime Q^\prime R^\prime$ and $TUV$ have the same orientation and a final reflection is not needed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We will produce a sequence of translations, rotations, reflections, and/or dilations which transform $\triangle ABC$ into $\triangle DEF$. There are many ways to do this: here we will use a translation to map $A$ to $D$, then a rotation to align two of the sides of the two triangles, and finally a dilation which completes the similarity transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Translation</strong></p>

<p>The translation taking $A$ to $D$ is pictured below, with the image of $\triangle ABC$ being denoted by $A^\prime B^\prime C^\prime$.</p>

<p><img alt=""Similartriangles4_44378ca38d0884060bf8f83bc865c1a4"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/992/max/similartriangles4_44378ca38d0884060bf8f83bc865c1a4.jpg?1362867802"" /></p>

<p>Note that $A^\prime = D$ because the translation is chosen precisely so as to map $A$ to $D$.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Rotation</strong></p>

<p>We rotate $\triangle A^\prime B^\prime C^\prime$ by angle $C^\prime A^\prime F$ as pictured below where the angle of rotation is marked in green:</p>

<p><img alt=""Similartriangles5_afd202f26f2d8d0f64d6113d1853dfd5"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/993/max/similartriangles5_afd202f26f2d8d0f64d6113d1853dfd5.jpg?1362867822"" /></p>

<p>Also pictured is the image $A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime}$ of $\triangle A^\prime B^\prime C^\prime$ under this rotation. Note that $\overrightarrow{A^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}} = \overrightarrow{AC}$. This is true by the choice of our angle of rotation. Note too that $\overrightarrow{A^{\prime \prime} B^{\prime \prime}} = \overrightarrow{DE}$: this is true because $m(\angle B^{\prime \prime}A^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}) = m(\angle BAC)$, since rigid motions preserve angle measures, and $m(\angle BAC) = m(\angle EDF)$ by hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Dilation</strong></p>

<p>We have already moved $A^{\prime \prime}$ to $D$ and so we choose $D$ as the center of our dilation. We would like to move $B^{\prime \prime}$ to $E$ and the dilation factor which will accomplish this is $\frac{|DE|}{|A^{\prime \prime} B^{\prime \prime}|}$. To check that $C^{\prime \prime}$ maps to $F$ note that $m(\angle DEF) = m(\angle A^{\prime \prime}B^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime})$. Angles are preserved by dilations and so this means that $\overline{B^{\prime \prime}C^{\prime \prime}}$ must map to $\overline{EF}$ (if $C^{\prime \prime}$ mapped to a point different than $F$ then there would be two rays from $E$ to points on $\overleftrightarrow{DF}$ making the same angle with $\overrightarrow{ED}$ which is not possible).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. We first show that $\triangle ACB$ is similar to $\triangle ADC$. We know that</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>$m(\angle ACB) = m(\angle CDA)$ by hypothesis,</p>
	</li>
	<li>$m(\angle CAB) = m(\angle DAC)$ because these are the same angle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore by AA similarity, $\triangle ACB$ is similar to $\triangle ADC$. Alternatively $\angle DCA$ is complementary to $\angle DAC$ and $\angle CBA$ is complementary to $\angle CAB$. Angles complementary to congruent angles must be congruent so $\angle DCA$ is congruent to $\angle CBA$. By AAA similiarty $\triangle ACB$ is similar to $\triangle ADC$.</p>

<p>Similar reasoning will establish that $\triangle ACB$ is similar to $\triangle CDB$:</p>

<p>By AA similarity (or AAA similarity if we make an extra argument as above), $\triangle ACB$ is similar to $\triangle CDB$.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>$m(\angle ACB) = m(\angle CDB)$ by hypothesis,</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>$m(\angle CBA) = m(\angle DBC)$ because these are the same angle.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>b. The two triangle similarity results from part (a) allow us to set up different proportions involving corresponding pairs of sides in the similar triangles. With two pairs of similar triangles (three if we include the fact that $\triangle ADC$ is similar to $\triangle DCB$ since both are similar to $\triangle ACB$) this gives us six possible proportions. Some care is needed in order to choose the ones which will give the Pythagorean theorem without too much trial and error.</p>

<p>Suppose we set $a = |BC|$, $b = |AC|$, $c = |AB|$. In order to get an $a^2$ we would like to use the two occurrences of $\overline{BC}$, one in $\triangle ACB$ and one in $\triangle CDB$:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{|BC|}{|BA|} = \frac{|BD|}{|BC|} $$</p>

<p>which we can rewrite as</p>

<p>$$ \frac{a}{c} = \frac{|BD|}{a}. $$</p>

<p>Similarly, to get a $b^2$ we need to use the two occurrences of $\overline{AC}$, one in $\triangle ACB$ and the other in $\triangle ADC$:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{|AC|}{|AB|} = \frac{|AD|}{|AC|} $$</p>

<p>which we can rewrite as</p>

<p>$$ \frac{b}{c} = \frac{|AD|}{b}. $$</p>

<p>Clearing denominators in our two fraction equivalences gives us $a^2 = c|BD|$ and $b^2 = c|AD|$. Adding these two equations together gives</p>

<div>\begin{align} a^2 + b^2 &amp;= c(|BD| + |AD|) \\ &amp;= c|AB| \\ &amp;= c^2. \end{align}</div>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Let $x$ be the distance from the northeast corner of the table at which Pablo wants the cue ball to hit the east wall. We start by drawing two right triangles as shown in the diagram above: one whose hypotenuse is the segment from the desired point of contact with the east wall to the north pocket, and one whose hypotenuse is the segment from the cue ball to the point of contact with the east wall. The former right triangle has legs of length 4 ft. and $x$ ft.; the latter has legs of length 7 ft. (because the cue ball begins one foot away from the west wall) and $(3 - x)$ ft. (because it begins one foot away from the south wall).</p>

	<p>Because the angle at which the cue ball hits the wall is equal to the angle at which it rebounds off of it, and because the two right triangles already have one right angle each, we know the two triangles are similar by AA similarity, and therefore $$ \frac{7}{(3 - x)} = \frac{4}{x}. $$ Multiplying each side by $x(3 - x)$ yields $$7x = 4(3 - x)$$ and we obtain $x = \frac{12}{11}$ ft. Therefore, Pablo wants the cue ball to contact the east wall $\frac{12}{11}$ ft. away from the northeast corner of the table.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Suppose we form another right triangle by drawing the perpendicular from the eight-ball to the north wall. This produces a right triangle that is similar to the one in the upper-right corner of the table. Since the foot of the perpendicular is 2 ft. away from the north pocket, the scale factor between the two triangles is $\frac12$. So the eight-ball should be placed half of $\frac{12}{11}$ ft., or $\frac{6}{11}$ ft., away from the north wall.</p>

<p>This alternative solution uses a clever strategy in which we picture the reflection of the pool table across the east wall. Because the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection when the cue ball collides with the east wall, if we reflect the continuation of the ball&#39;s trajectory across the east wall, this reflection will form a straight line with the ball&#39;s initial trajectory. We can use this fact to determine exactly where the cue ball should &quot;cross&quot; the east wall in this diagram. (In fact, if a pool table came with mirrors on each wall, Pablo could use this strategy to aim his shot perfectly, since he could simply direct his shot at the north pocket&#39;s reflection in the east wall mirror.)</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>We draw a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the segment from the cue ball to the reflection of the north pocket. The legs of this right triangle are 7 ft. + 4 ft. = 11 ft. and 3 ft., since the cue ball starts one foot away from the west wall and one foot away from the south wall. Let the distance from the desired point of contact with the east wall and the horizontal leg of this right triangle be $y$ feet. Then our right triangle contains another, similar right triangle (by AA similarity) whose legs have length $y$ ft. and 7 ft. Therefore, the scale factor between this smaller triangle and the original right triangle is $\frac{7}{11}$. To compute $y$, then, we multiply 3 by $\frac{7}{11}$ to get $\frac{21}{11}$. Thus the ball should hit the east wall $\frac{21}{11}$ ft. north of the horizontal dotted line in the diagram. This is $3 - \frac{21}{11} = \frac{12}{11}$ feet away from the northeast corner pocket.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We draw a perpendicular from the reflection of the eight-ball&#39;s desired position to the reflection of the north wall. With the reflection of the north wall, this perpendicular forms a right triangle that is similar to the one with legs of 3 feet and 11 feet by AA similarity (using the fact that the smallest angle of the new triangle and the smallest angle of the old triangle are alternate interior angles for two parallel horizontal lines). The horizontal leg of the new triangle has length 2 feet, so the scale factor between the two triangles is $\frac{2}{11}$. So to compute the length of the perpendicular from the reflection of the eight-ball to the reflection of the north wall, we multiply 3 feet by $\frac{2}{11}$ to get $\frac{6}{11}$ feet. Thus the eight-ball should be placed $\frac{6}{11}$ feet away from the north wall.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Below is a picture of a triangle $DEF$ whose angles are congruent to the corresponding angles of $\triangle ABC$ and whose sides are proportional (with scale factor 1/2) to the corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Trig2_4dc2e8fbfed58cf10f805bfef5bf9826"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/755/large/trig2_4dc2e8fbfed58cf10f805bfef5bf9826.jpg?1380488365"" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Since corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ are proportional, this means that $$ \frac{|DE|}{|DF|} = \frac{|AB|}{|AC|}. $$ Concretely, $|DE| = \frac{1}{2}|AB|$ and $|DF| = \frac{1}{2}|AC|$. The displayed equation above is true, however, for any other scale factor as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Here is a picture of $\triangle ABC$ with $\angle B$ a right angle:</p>

	<p><img alt=""Trig3_5e08699c473fceadffef5b40cdffa911"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/756/large/trig3_5e08699c473fceadffef5b40cdffa911.jpg?1380501258"" /></p>

	<p>Because $\angle B$ is right and the sum of the angles in $\triangle ABC$ is 180 degrees, this means that $m(\angle C) = 180 - 90 - m(\angle A)$. Choosing $m(\angle A)$ determines $m(\angle C)$. If $DEF$ is any other right triangle with $m(\angle E) = 90$ and $m(\angle D) = m(\angle A)$ then $m(\angle F) = m(\angle C)$ and so $\triangle DEF$ is similar to $\triangle ABC$. We just saw in part (b) that the ratios of sides of similar triangles are equivalent and so the ratios $|AB|:|AC|$ and $|DE|:|DF|$ are equivalent (as are $|BC|: |AC|$ and $|EF|:|DF|$).</p>

	<p>A more abstract way of stating this argument is the following. Triangles are similar when they have two congruent corresponding angles. If we restrict our attention to <em>right</em> triangles this guarantees one pair of congruent corresponding angles (measuring 90 degrees). So if two right triangles share one pair of congruent corresponding acute angles, then they are similar and the ratios of their corresponding side lengths are equivalent.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>As we saw in part (c) one special property of asking for $\angle B$ to be a right angle is that two right triangles sharing a second congruent angle are necessarily similar and this makes the ratio of sides independent of the size of the (right) triangle. For non-right triangles, these side ratios depend on the triangle unless we make sure to specify a <em>second</em> angle measure in common.</p>

	<p>An additional advantage to working with a right triangle is that we have the Pythagorean Theorem. For the triangle in part (c), this says that $$ |AB|^2 + |BC|^2 = |AC|^2. $$ Rewriting this gives $$ \left(\frac{|AB|}{|AC|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{|BC|}{|AC|}\right)^2 = 1. $$ Viewing our trigonometric ratios as fractions, this is the same as $$ \cos^2(\angle A) + \sin^2(\angle A) = 1. $$ This is the most important and fundamental of all trigonometric identities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. To find $\sin{a}$ we draw a right triangle $ABC$ and we assume that $m(\angle A) = a$:</p>

<p><img alt=""Sin_fd97afc95122e99d17b0a26d6347361b"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/757/large/sin_fd97afc95122e99d17b0a26d6347361b.jpg?1380762470"" /></p>

<p>The sine of $\angle A$ is the length of the side opposite $\angle A$ divided by the length of the hypotenuse:</p>

<p>$$ \sin{a} = \frac{|BC|}{|AC|}. $$</p>

<p>Since $\angle B$ is a right angle we have $m(\angle A) + m(\angle C) + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$ and so $m(\angle C) = 90^\circ - a$. Since the cosine of $\angle C$ is the length of the side adjacent to $C$ divided by the length of the hypotenuse we have</p>

<p>$$ \cos{(90 -a)} = \frac{|BC|}{|AC|}. $$</p>

<p>Thus $\sin{a} = \cos{(90-a)}$. The only property of $a$ that we have used in this argument is that it is one of the (non right) angles in a right triangle. So $\sin{a} = \cos{(90-a)}$ for any $0 \lt a \lt 90$.</p>

<p>b. Reasoning from the picture above, we have</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} \sin{a} &amp;= \frac{|BC|}{|AC|},\\ \cos{a} &amp;= \frac{|AB|}{|AC|}. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>So if $\sin{a} = \cos{a}$ then $|AB| = |BC|$. This means that $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles and so $a = 45$.</p>

<p>Alternatively, $\sin{0} = 0$ and $\sin{90} = 1$ and the function $\sin{x}$ increases as $x$ increases from 0 to 90. On the other hand $\cos{0} = 1$ and $\cos{90} = 0$ and the function $\cos{x}$ decreases as $x$ increases from 0 to 90. This means that $\sin{x}$ and $\cos{x}$ can take the same value for at most one number $x$ between 0 and 90. They do take the same value when $x = 45$ since $\sin{45} = \cos{45} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.</p>

<p>Selina has a 9 meter by 12 meter lawn that she wants to water. She has two sprinklers, each of which can water grass within an 8.4-meter radius. Selina wants to set up the two sprinklers so that they are on corners of the lawn. She would like for the sprinklers to water as much of the lawn as possible, because she will have to manually water the part of the lawn that is not covered by the sprinklers.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Selina considers two different strategies for placing the sprinklers. One strategy is to put the sprinklers at opposite ends of a 12-meter side of the lawn. The other is to put the sprinklers at opposite corners of the lawn. (See the figures below.) Which strategy appears to be best? Justify your answer.<br />

</ol>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>In both sprinkler placements, each sprinkler covers a 90-degree sector of a circle of radius 8.4 meters. However, in each placement, the areas covered by the two sprinklers overlap. The placement that produces the smallest area of overlap will cover more area overall, since the total area covered is equal to the sum of the areas of the two 90-degree sectors minus the overlap.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt=""Sprinklersmetric_dca76c404f80cc609a03ccd245fcf06c"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/599/large/sprinklersmetric_dca76c404f80cc609a03ccd245fcf06c.jpg?1332552714"" /><br />
	If we draw the areas covered by the sprinklers in each of the two placements, it appears as though the overlap is slightly smaller if we place the sprinklers at the two corners. We will compute the total area covered by each placement in order to confirm this.</li>
	<li>We&#39;ll start by computing the area covered if Selina puts the two sprinklers at opposite ends of a 12-meter side of the lawn.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt=""Sprinklers1_2aa35c0f31d3836117ebfd77d058f4ab"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/533/large/sprinklers1_2aa35c0f31d3836117ebfd77d058f4ab.jpg?1332044975"" /><br />
	<br />
	Let A and B be opposite ends of the 12-meter side of the lawn where the sprinklers are placed. Let X be the point where the two quarter-circles of radius 8.4 meters centered at A and B intersect, and let M be the foot of the perpendicular from X to side AB. (This is also the midpoint of AB.)<br />
	<br />
	We&#39;ll decompose the area covered by the two sprinklers into the isosceles triangle ABX and two circular sectors (one in each circle). We know that AM = 6 meters and AX = 8.4 meters, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, XM $\approx$ 5.88 meters. So the area of triangle ABX is approximately $$ \mbox{Area} = \frac12 \cdot XM \cdot AB \approx \frac12 \cdot 5.88 \cdot 12 \approx 35.3 \mbox{ m}^2 . $$ The measure of angle XAM is $\arccos \frac{6}{8.4} \approx 44.4^\circ$. So the remainder of the covered area consists of two 45.6-degree sectors of circles of radius 8.4 meters. Each of these sectors has area $$ \mbox{Area} \approx \frac{90 - \arccos \frac{6}{8.4}}{360} \cdot \pi \cdot 8.4^2 \approx 28.1 \mbox{ m}^2. $$ So the total area covered is approximately 35.3 + 2(28.1) = 91.5 square meters, or about 84.7 percent of the lawn.<br />
	<br />
	Now we compute the area covered if Selina places the sprinklers at opposite corners of the lawn:<br />
	<br />
	<img alt=""Sprinklers2_4214abed6e840c032c7d77579db39947"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/000/534/large/sprinklers2_4214abed6e840c032c7d77579db39947.jpg?1332048073"" /><br />
	<br />
	Let A and B be two opposite corners of the lawn, let P and Q be the two points at which quarter-circles of radius 8.4 meters centered at A and B intersect, and let X be the point at which the segments AB and PQ intersect. (This is also the center of the lawn.)<br />
	<br />
	This time, we decompose the area covered into the rhombus APBQ and four circular sectors. The length of the diagonal AB is 15 meters by the Pythagorean Theorem, so AX = 7.5 meters. Since AP = 8.4 meters, by the Pythagorean Theorem, PX $= \sqrt{8.4^2 - 7.5^2}$ meters, and thus PQ $= 2\sqrt{8.4^2 - 7.5^2} \approx$ 7.57 meters. So the area of rhombus APBQ is $$ \mbox{Area} = \frac12 \cdot AB \cdot PQ \approx \frac12 \cdot 15 \cdot 7.57 \approx 56.8 \mbox{ m}^2. $$ Since $m\angle PAX = \arccos \frac{7.5}{8.4}$, the measure of angle PAQ is approximately $2\arccos \frac{7.5}{8.4} \approx$ 53.5 degrees. So the two sectors of circle A not covered by the rhombus add up to a 36.5-degree sector of a circle of radius 8.4 meters. The same is true of the two sectors of circle B not covered by the rhombus, so the remaining area is equivalent to approximately a 73.0-degree sector of a circle of radius 8.4 meters: $$ \mbox{Area} \approx \frac{73.0}{360} \cdot \pi \cdot 8.4^2 \approx 44.9 \mbox{ m}^2. $$ So the total area covered by the sprinklers in this case is approximately 56.7 + 44.9 = 101.6 square meters, or about 94.1 percent of the lawn. This confirms that the strategy of placing the sprinklers at opposite corners of the lawn is significantly better.</li>
	<li>It is in fact possible to water the entire lawn with one sprinkler if we are allowed to place sprinklers in the interior of the lawn. Suppose we place one sprinkler in the center of the lawn. Then the corners of the rectangle are $\sqrt{4.5^2 + 6^2} = 7.5$ meters away, which is smaller than the sprinkler&#39;s reach. Since the corners of a rectangle are the points farthest from the center, one sprinkler placed in the center can water the entire lawn.</li>

<p>Triangles $AMC$ and $BMC$ are congruent as we can show with $SSS$:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>$\overline{AM}$ is congruent to $\overline{BM}$ since $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$,</li>
	<li>$\overline{AC}$ is congruent to $\overline{BC}$ because triangle $ABC$ is equilaterial,</li>
	<li>$\overline{MC}$ is congruent to $\overline{MC}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Angles $CMB$ and $CMA$ are corresponding angles of the congruent triangles $AMC$ and $BMC$ and so are congruent. Since these two angles make a line and are congruent they must each be right angles. We can therefore apply the Pythagorean theorem to $\triangle AMC$ to find $|MC|$: $$ |MC|^2 + |AM|^2 = |AC|^2. $$ We know that $|AM| = \frac{1}{2}$ since $|AB| = 1$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $|AB|$. We were also given that $|AC| = 1$. Plugging this information into formula above we get $$ |MC|^2 + \frac{1}{4} = 1. $$ So $|MC|^2 = \frac{3}{4}$ and $$ |MC| = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. $$ Now we have found the height of triangle $ABC$, using $\overline {AB}$ as a base, and so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $$ \frac{1}{2}\times 1 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}. $$</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Trigonometric ratios </span></p>

<p>We label the triangle vertices $A,B,C$ as in the previous solution. Suppose line $\ell$ bisects angle $A$, as in the picture below, and let $M$ be the point of intersection of $\ell$ with $\overline{AB}$:</p>

<p>Since $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, we know that $m(\angle A) = m(\angle B) = m(\angle C) = 60$. We have $m(\angle ACM) = m(\angle BCM) = 30$ since $\overrightarrow{CM}$ bisects angle $C$. The sum of the three angles in $\triangle ACM$ is $180^\circ$. Since $m(\angle CAM) = 60$ and $m(\angle ACM) = 30$ this means that $m(\angle CMA) = 90$. So $\overline{MC}$ is an altitude for triangle $ABC$, using $\overline{AB}$ as a base. To find the height of the altitude we can use trigonometry: $$ \sin{\angle A} = \frac{|MC|}{|AC|}. $$ Since $\sin{60^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $|AC| = 1$ we have $$ |MC| = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. $$ Since $|AB| = 1$ we find that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $$ \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}. $$</p>

<p>Note that writing the numbers $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$ in the form $a+bi$ is deceptively simple as, for example, $i=0+1i$ (that is, we take $a=0$ and $b=1$).</p>

<p>a. Below is a table with the requested powers of $i$. Note that these can be computed by systematically multiplying by increasing powers of $i$, e.g., $$ i^3=i^2\cdot i=-1\cdot i=-i,$$ which can be written in the form $-i=0+(-1)i$, and then $$ i^4=i^3\cdot i=(-i)\cdot i=-i^2=-(-1)=1,$$ which similarly can be written as $1=1+0i.$</p>

<p>b. We observe that the pattern of powers of $i$ is cyclical, repeating every 4 exponents. When the exponent is an integer multiple of 4, the result is a 1. Exponents which are one more than a multiple of 4 give a result of $i$, and so on. To make this precise, we simply observe that any integer can be written as a multiple of 4, plus either 0, 1, 2, or 3. We can justify this pattern as follows: To compute $i^n$, we write $n=4k+a$ (where $a$ is 0, 1, 2, or 3), and then observe $$ i^n=i^{4k+a}=(i^4)^k\times i^a=a^k\times i^a=i^a. $$</p>

<p>That is, we can compute $i^n$ by computing $i^a$, where $a$ is the remainder upon dividing $n$ by 4.</p>

<p>Since $195$ is three more than the multiple $192=4\cdot 48$, we have $i^{195}=i^3=-i$.</p>

<p>c. Here are the algebraic solutions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$i^2 + i + 1 = -1 + i + 1 = i$</li>
	<li>$i^3 + i^2 + i +1 = -i + -1 + i + 1 = 0$</li>
	<li>$i^4 + i^3 + i^2 + i +1 = 1 + -i + -1 + i + 1 = 1$</li>
	<li>$i^5 + i^4 + i^3 + i^2 + i +1 = i + 1 + -i + -1 + i + 1 = 1 + i$</li>
	<li>$i^6 + i^5 + i^4 + i^3 + i^2 + i +1 = -1 + i + 1 + -i + -1 + i + 1 = i$</li>
	<li>$i^7 + i^6 + i^5 + i^4 + i^3 + i^2 + i +1 = -i + -1 + i + 1 + -i + -1 + i + 1 = 0$</li>
	<li>$i^8 + i^7 + i^6 + i^5 + i^4 + i^3 + i^2 + i +1 = 1 + -i + -1 + i + 1 + -i + -1 + i + 1 = 1$</li>
</ul>

<p>d. Note that the number of terms is 1 more than the largest exponent in the sum. Using the pattern for $i^n$ observed in the previous parts, we see that the sum of the first 196 powers of $i$ (starting with $i^0$) is simply $$ \underbrace{\underbrace{1 + -i + -1 + i}_{=0} + \underbrace{1 + -i + -1 + i}_{=0}+\cdots+ \underbrace{1 + -i + -1 + i}_{=0}}_{\text{196 total terms, divided into 48 smaller groups that each sum to 0}}=0. $$ Though not required by the task, this statement generalizes nicely -- whenever the number of terms is a multiple of 4, the corresponding sum will be 0. Whenever the number of terms is one more than a multiple of 4, then there will be one term left over when we are done collecting these groups of 4: The sum $$ \underbrace{1 + -i + -1 + i}_{=0} + \underbrace{1 + -i + -1 + i}_{=0}+\cdots+ \underbrace{1 + -i + -1 + i}_{=0}+1=1 $$ evaluates to 1 as there will be only a single &quot;1&quot; which does not dispappear by virtue of being in a group of 4. Similarly, if the number of terms is two more than a multiple of 4, the result is $1+i$, and if the number of terms is three more than a multiple of 4, the result is $1+i+-1=i$.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could verify that the formula for a finite geometric series is valid even when the base of the series is $i$. (This is done identically to the case for real numbers). Applying this formula gives $$ 1+i+i^2+\cdots+i^n=\frac{1-i^{n+1}}{1-i} $$ and then apply our knowledge from above about the powers of $i$. For example, when $n$ is three more than a multiple of $4$, then $n+1$ is a multiple of 4, so $i^{n+1}=1$, and we concldue $$ 1+i+i^2+\cdots+i^n=\frac{1-i^{n+1}}{1-i}=\frac{1-1}{1-i}=0, $$ the same result as above. This applies in particular to the example of $n=195$ requested in the problem.</p>

<p>Rewrite each of the following expressions involving complex numbers in the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.</p>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. We have \begin{eqnarray*} (3 + 2i)(2 - 5i) &amp; = &amp; 3(2 - 5i) + 2i(2 - 5i) \\ &amp; = &amp; 6 - 15i + 4i - 10i^2 \\ &amp; = &amp; 6 - 15i + 4i + 10 \\ &amp; = &amp; 16 - 11i. \\ \end{eqnarray*} Note that we have used the fact that $i^2 = -1$ to write $-10i^2 = 10$.</p>

<p>b. We can evaluate this expression by computing each product of binomials separately and then subtracting. However, we can make our job easier by noticing that each product contains a factor (17 - 13i), and factoring this out to obtain \begin{eqnarray*} (5 + 4i)(17 - 13i) - (5 + 3i)(17 - 13i) &amp; = &amp; ((5 + 4i) - (5 + 3i))(17 - 13i) \\ &amp; = &amp; i(17 - 13i) \\ &amp; = &amp; 17i - 13i^2 \\ &amp; = &amp; 13 + 17i. \\ \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>c. Again, it is possible to square each binomial separately and then subtract, but since we have an expression of the form $x^2 - y^2$, let&#39;s try factoring the given expression as a difference of squares: \begin{eqnarray*} \left(\frac52 + \frac{7i}{2} \right)^2 - \left(\frac52 + \frac{i}{2} \right)^2 &amp; = &amp; \left(\left( \frac52 + \frac{7i}{2} \right) - \left( \frac52 + \frac{i}{2} \right) \right) \left( \left( \frac52 + \frac{7i}{2} \right) + \left( \frac52 + \frac{i}{2} \right) \right) \\ &amp; = &amp; 3i(5 + 4i) \\ &amp; = &amp; 15i + 12i^2 \\ &amp; = &amp; -12 + 15i \\ \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>d. By the commutative and associative properties, we can pair and multiply the factors of this expression in whatever order we want. Since we see two complex conjugates - namely, (1 + i) and (1 - i) - we will try pairing and multiplying those first: \begin{eqnarray*} (1 + i)(13 - 4i)(1 - i) &amp; = &amp; (1 + i)(1 - i)(13 - 4i) \\ &amp; = &amp; (1 - i^2)(13 - 4i) \\ &amp; = &amp; 2(13 - 4i) \\ &amp; = &amp; 26 - 8i. \\ \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>e. We know that $i^2 = -1$, and $i^3 = i^2 \cdot i = -i$. So $$ 1 + i + i^2 + i^3 = 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = 0. $$</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 Factoring a polynomial </span></strong></p>

<p>a. We are trying to find solutions to the equation $x^3 = 1$ which are the roots of the equation $x^3-1=0$. One solution is $x = 1$. This means that $x-1$ divides $x^3 -1$ with no remainder. Performing long division, we find $$ x^3-1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1). $$ To find the roots of the polynomial $x^2 +x+ 1$ we can use the quadratic formula which says that the roots are $$ \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1-4}}{2} = \frac{-1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2}. $$ We know that $i^2 = -1$ so $(\sqrt{3}i)^2 = -3$ and this means that $\sqrt{-3} = \sqrt{3}i$. So our two roots of $x^2 - x + 1$ are $$ -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i $$</p>

<p>We have found 3 solutions to $x^3-1 = 0$, namely $x = 1, x = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2},$ and $x = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}$.</p>

<p>b. We can apply the same technique to solve the equation $x^4 = 1$ or $x^4 - 1 = 0$. We can first write $x^4 -1$ as a difference of squares: $$ x^4-1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1). $$ We have $x^2 -1 = (x+1)(x-1)$. Similarly we have $x^2 + 1 = (x+i)(x-i)$. So this gives $$ x^4 + 1 = (x+i)(x-i)(x+1)(x-1) $$ and the solutions to $x^4-1 = 0$ are $x = -i,i,-1,1$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Using Geometry </span></strong></p>

<p>Suppose $z$ is a complex number which can be written in polar form as follows: $$ z = re^{i\theta}. $$ Here $r$ represents the distance from $z$ to 0 and $\theta$ is the measure of the directed angle made by the non-negative real numbers and the ray from 0 through $z$. One important property of the polar form is that it facilitates calculating powers:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} z^n &amp;= \left(re^{i\theta}\right)^n \\ &amp;= r^ne^{in\theta}. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>a. Using the polar form for a complex number $z$ and its properties indicated above, $z = re^{i\theta}$ is a cube root of 1 when $z^3 = 1$ or $$ r^3e^{i3\theta} = 1. $$ This means that $r^3 = 1,$ so $r = 1$ since $r$ is a real number and $r\geq0$. Moreover $3\theta$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$. This means we can have $\theta = 0$, $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}$, or $\theta = \frac{4\pi}{3}$. These are the solutions for $\theta$ that we find by choosing our integer multiple of $\pi$ to be 0, 1, and 2. If we choose different integer multiples we will find angles that differ from the three listed above by an integer multiple of 2$\pi$. The three cube roots of 1 are pictured below: &nbsp;<br />
<br />

<br />
Notice that the three numbers whose cube is 1 evenly divide the unit circle into 3 equal pieces.</p>

<p>b. Writing $z = re^{i\theta}$, the solutions of $z^4 = 1$ are the same as the solutions to $$ r^4e^{i4\theta} = 1. $$ This means that $r^4 = 1,$ so $r=1$ since $r$ is a real number and $r \geq 0$. In addition $4\theta$ must be an integer multiple of $2\pi$. Choosing multiples of 0, 1, 2, and 3 gives $\theta= 0, \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi, \frac{3\pi}{2}$. These correspond to the four numbers 1, $i$, -1, and $-i$, as pictured below:<br />

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 3 Solving equations </span></strong></p>

<p>a. Writing $(a+bi)^3=(a^3-3ab^2)+(3a^2b-b^3)i=1+0i$ and equating real and imaginary parts of $(a+bi)^3=1$ gives $$ a^3 - 3ab^2 = 1 $$ and $$ 3a^2b - b^3 = 0 $$ Factoring the second equation as $b(3a^2-b^2)=0$, we see that either $b=0$ or $3a^2=b^2$. If $b=0$, then $a^3=1$, giving the obvious cube root of 1. If $b\neq 0$, then $3a^2=b^2$, and substituting this into $a^3-3ab^2=1$ gives $a^3-9a^3=1$, so $a=-\frac{1}{2}$, and then $b=\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.</p>

<p>b. Similarly, if we write $$ (a+bi)^4=((a^2-b^2)+2abi)^2= (a^4-6a^2b^2+b^4)+(4a^3b-4ab^3)i $$ then equating imaginary parts in $(a+bi)^4=1$, gives $$(4a^3b-4ab^3)=0. $$ Factoring the left-hand side as $4ab(a^2-b^2)=0$, we see that any 4th root of 1 must have $a=0$, $b=0$, or $a^2=b^2$. If $a=0$, then the equation $(bi)^4=1$ quickly gives $b=\pm 1$. Similarly, if $b=0$, then the equation $a^4=1$ again gives $a=\pm 1$ (remember that $a$ and $b$ are real). Finally, if $a=\pm b$, then equating the real parts of $(a\pm ai)^4=1$ gives $$ (a^4-6a^2a^2+a^4)=1 $$ or $-4a^4=1$. Since there are no real values of $a$ for which this is true, the only solutions to these equations are $(a,b)=(\pm 1,0)$ and $(a,b)=(0,\pm 1)$, corresponding to the four roots $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Renee reasons as follows to solve the equation $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.</p>

<blockquote>First I will rewrite this as a square plus some number. $$ x^2 + x + 1 = \left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}. $$ Now I can subtract $\frac{3}{4}$ from both sides of the equation $$ \left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{3}{4}. $$ But I can&#39;t take the square root of a negative number so I can&#39;t solve this equation.</blockquote>

<p>a. Show how Renee might have continued to find the complex solutions of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.</p>

<p>b. Apply Renee&#39;s reasoning to find the solutions to $x^2 + 4x + 6 = 0$.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. Renee is right that any real number squared is non-negative and so the square root of a negative number can not be equal to a real number. In the complex numbers, however, we have the number $i$ which satisfies $i^2 = -1$ and this allows us to take the square root of a negative number. Looking at the equation $$ \left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{3}{4}, $$ The square root of $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and so</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\right)^2 &amp;= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2i^2 \\ &amp;= \frac{3}{4} \times (-1) \\ &amp;= -\frac{3}{4}. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>So we have $$ x+\frac{1}{2} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i $$ with the plus or minus sign coming from the fact we have squared the quantity $x + \frac{1}{2}$. Thus the two solutions to the equation $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are $-\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.</p>

<p>b. To solve $x^2 + 4x + 6 = 0$ using Renee&#39;s technique we first look to write $x^2 + 4x$ as part of a perfect square. Since $(x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$ we have $$ x^2 + 4x + 6 = (x+2)^2 + 2. $$ So we need to find the solutions to $(x+2)^2 + 2 = 0$. Subtracting 2 from both sides and taking the square root we find $$ x = -2 \pm \sqrt{2}i $$</p>

<p>For any number $a$ we have $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$. So when we want to write $x^2 + 4x + 6$ as a sum of a square plus a real number we need $x^2 + 2ax = x^2 + 4x$ which means $2a = 4$ or $a = 2$. So $(x+2)^2$ is the <em>only</em> perfect square whose quadratic and linear terms are $x^2$ and $4x$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 Factoring a polynomial </span></strong></p>

<p>a. We are trying to find solutions to the equation $x^3 = 1$ which are the roots of the equation $x^3-1=0$. One solution is $x = 1$. This means that $x-1$ divides $x^3 -1$ with no remainder. Performing long division, we find $$ x^3-1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1). $$ To find the roots of the polynomial $x^2 +x+ 1$ we can use the quadratic formula which says that the roots are $$ \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1-4}}{2} = \frac{-1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2}. $$ We know that $i^2 = -1$ so $(\sqrt{3}i)^2 = -3$ and this means that $\sqrt{-3} = \sqrt{3}i$. So our two roots of $x^2 - x + 1$ are $$ -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i $$</p>

<p>We have found 3 solutions to $x^3-1 = 0$, namely $x = 1, x = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2},$ and $x = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}$.</p>

<p>b. We can apply the same technique to solve the equation $x^4 = 1$ or $x^4 - 1 = 0$. We can first write $x^4 -1$ as a difference of squares: $$ x^4-1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1). $$ We have $x^2 -1 = (x+1)(x-1)$. Similarly we have $x^2 + 1 = (x+i)(x-i)$. So this gives $$ x^4 + 1 = (x+i)(x-i)(x+1)(x-1) $$ and the solutions to $x^4-1 = 0$ are $x = -i,i,-1,1$.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Using Geometry </span></strong></p>

<p>Suppose $z$ is a complex number which can be written in polar form as follows: $$ z = re^{i\theta}. $$ Here $r$ represents the distance from $z$ to 0 and $\theta$ is the measure of the directed angle made by the non-negative real numbers and the ray from 0 through $z$. One important property of the polar form is that it facilitates calculating powers:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} z^n &amp;= \left(re^{i\theta}\right)^n \\ &amp;= r^ne^{in\theta}. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>a. Using the polar form for a complex number $z$ and its properties indicated above, $z = re^{i\theta}$ is a cube root of 1 when $z^3 = 1$ or $$ r^3e^{i3\theta} = 1. $$ This means that $r^3 = 1,$ so $r = 1$ since $r$ is a real number and $r\geq0$. Moreover $3\theta$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$. This means we can have $\theta = 0$, $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}$, or $\theta = \frac{4\pi}{3}$. These are the solutions for $\theta$ that we find by choosing our integer multiple of $\pi$ to be 0, 1, and 2. If we choose different integer multiples we will find angles that differ from the three listed above by an integer multiple of 2$\pi$. The three cube roots of 1 are pictured below: &nbsp;<br />

<br />
Notice that the three numbers whose cube is 1 evenly divide the unit circle into 3 equal pieces.</p>

<p>b. Writing $z = re^{i\theta}$, the solutions of $z^4 = 1$ are the same as the solutions to $$ r^4e^{i4\theta} = 1. $$ This means that $r^4 = 1,$ so $r=1$ since $r$ is a real number and $r \geq 0$. In addition $4\theta$ must be an integer multiple of $2\pi$. Choosing multiples of 0, 1, 2, and 3 gives $\theta= 0, \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi, \frac{3\pi}{2}$. These correspond to the four numbers 1, $i$, -1, and $-i$, as pictured below:<br />

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: 3 Solving equations </span></strong></p>

<p>a. Writing $(a+bi)^3=(a^3-3ab^2)+(3a^2b-b^3)i=1+0i$ and equating real and imaginary parts of $(a+bi)^3=1$ gives $$ a^3 - 3ab^2 = 1 $$ and $$ 3a^2b - b^3 = 0 $$ Factoring the second equation as $b(3a^2-b^2)=0$, we see that either $b=0$ or $3a^2=b^2$. If $b=0$, then $a^3=1$, giving the obvious cube root of 1. If $b\neq 0$, then $3a^2=b^2$, and substituting this into $a^3-3ab^2=1$ gives $a^3-9a^3=1$, so $a=-\frac{1}{2}$, and then $b=\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.</p>

<p>b. Similarly, if we write $$ (a+bi)^4=((a^2-b^2)+2abi)^2= (a^4-6a^2b^2+b^4)+(4a^3b-4ab^3)i $$ then equating imaginary parts in $(a+bi)^4=1$, gives $$(4a^3b-4ab^3)=0. $$ Factoring the left-hand side as $4ab(a^2-b^2)=0$, we see that any 4th root of 1 must have $a=0$, $b=0$, or $a^2=b^2$. If $a=0$, then the equation $(bi)^4=1$ quickly gives $b=\pm 1$. Similarly, if $b=0$, then the equation $a^4=1$ again gives $a=\pm 1$ (remember that $a$ and $b$ are real). Finally, if $a=\pm b$, then equating the real parts of $(a\pm ai)^4=1$ gives $$ (a^4-6a^2a^2+a^4)=1 $$ or $-4a^4=1$. Since there are no real values of $a$ for which this is true, the only solutions to these equations are $(a,b)=(\pm 1,0)$ and $(a,b)=(0,\pm 1)$, corresponding to the four roots $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$.</p>

Sadie tells Nanette that her family&rsquo;s car is getting 42 miles per gallon. Nanette has no idea how that compares to her family&rsquo;s car because in Germany mileage is measured differently. She tells Sadie that her family&rsquo;s car uses 6 liters per 100 km. Which car is more fuel efficient?</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: mpg to </span></strong><span class=""unit""><strong>liters</strong></span><strong><span class=""unit""> per 100 km </span></strong></p>

<p>We need to convert miles per gallon to liters per 100 km. So we somehow have to get from miles to km and from gallons to liters. A quick Google search finds that 1 mile = 1.609 km and 1 gallon = 3.79 liters.</p>

<p>We can start by converting miles per gallon into km per liter.</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ gallon}} &amp;= \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ gallon}} \cdot \frac{1.609 \text{ km}}{1 \text{ mile}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ gallon}}{3.79 \text{ liters}} \\ &amp;= \frac{67.578 \text{ km}}{3.79 \text{ liters}} \end{align} $$</div>

<p>Since we want to find the answer in liters per unit distance, we need to take the reciprocal and convert the units in the denominator into 100 km to finish the computation:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} \frac{3.79 \text{ liters}}{67.578 \text{ km}} &amp;= 0.0561 \text{ liters per km} \\ &amp;= 5.61 \text{ liters per 100 km} \end{align} $$</div>

<p>This means that 42 miles per gallon is equivalent to 5.61 liters per 100 km, and Sadie&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s car is slightly more fuel efficient than Nanette&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s car.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""unit"">Solution: liters per 100 km to mpg </span></strong></p>

<p>As an alternative solution, we would start with 6 liters per 100 km and converted it to miles per gallon:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{6 \text{ liters}}{100 \text{ km}} = \frac{0.06 \text{ liters}}{1 \text{ km}} $$</p>

<p>This is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$ \frac{1 \text{ km}}{0.06 \text{ liters}} = \frac{1 \text{ km}}{0.06 \text{ liters}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{1.609 \text{ km}} \cdot \frac{3.79 \text{ liters}}{1 \text{ gallon}} = \frac{39.26 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ gallon}}. $$</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Method 1: Each person gets the same raise.</li>
		<li>Method 2: Each person gets the same percent raise based on their salary.</li>
		<li>Method 3: This is a slight variation on Method 1 - If some employees are part time and others are full time, every person gets the same raise per hour of work. For example, if one person works 40 hour and another person works 20 hours, then the first person gets twice as much money as the second person.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For each method we need different information.
	<ul>
		<li>For Method 1 we don&#39;t need any additional information. Each person gets a $2000 raise.</li>
		<li>For Method 2 we need to know the salary of each employee. Then we can figure out what percent increase will result in a total $10,000.</li>
		<li>For Method 3 we need to know how much each person is working. Then we can figure out what the raise per hour will be and compute the final raises.</li>
	</ul>

	<li>We already computed the raises for</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Method 1: Everybody gets $ \$10,000/5 = \$2000.$</li>
	<li>Method 3 is a slight variation of this. Assume three employees work 40 hours per week, one works 20 hours per week and the last one works 15 hours per week. Then the total number of hours per week is $$3\cdot 40 + 20 + 15 = 155.$$ Assuming that the company gives everybody 4 weeks of vacation the total number of work hours per year is $$155\cdot 48=7440.$$So the \$10,000 available for raises comes to $$\$10,000/7440\text { hours}\approx $1.34 \text{ per hour}.$$ So if you work 40 hours per week for 48 weeks, your raise is $40\cdot 48\cdot \$1.34 = \$2572.8.$ If you work 20 hours per week for 48 weeks, your raise is $20\cdot 48\cdot \$1.34 = \$1286.4.$ And if you work 15 hours per week for 48 weeks, your raise is $15\cdot 48\cdot \$1.34 = \$964.8$</li>
	<li>Method 2: This is probably the most mathematically sophisticated method. We first need to know everybody&#39;s salary. Supposed the salaries are \$70,000, \$50,000, \$50,000, \$35,000, \$30,000. If we want to give everybody the same percent raise, we are looking for a number $r$, such that $$(70,000+50,000+50,000+35,000+30,000)\cdot r = 10,000.$$ The sum of all the salaries is \$235,000. Therefore, we need to solve $$\$235,000r = $10,000$$ for $r$, which gives $r\approx 0.043$. So everybody will get about a 4.3% raise. The new salaries after the raises will be \$73,010, \$52,150, \$52,150, \$36,505, and \$31,290.</li>
	<li>
	<p>The answer here depends on your definition of fairness. In method 2 everybody gets the same percent raise. So if you have a high salary, you get a larger pay raise than if you have a lower salary. This is probably the method used most commonly.</p>

	<p>If your goal is to support lower paid employees, then method 3 is designed to accomplish this. Here the raise rewards number of hours worked and it does not depend on your salary at all. So lower paid employees receiver a larger percent raise than higher paid employees.</p>

	<p>Method 1 is probably the least fair by most definitions, since no matter how much you work, you receive the same raise. A person working few hours or earning a smaller salary would receive a much higher percent raise than a person working many hours or earning a higher salary.</p>

","<h1>Dinosaur Bones</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quincy is a tour guide at a museum of science and history. During a tour of the museum, he tells some visitors about a fossilized dinosaur bone that is on display in the museum. He says, &ldquo;Twenty years ago, a group of paleontologists donated this dinosaur bone to our museum. At the time, they told us that they had estimated the age of the bone to be approximately $90$ million years. So now, the bone is about $90$ million and $20$ years old.&rdquo; Evaluate the validity of Quincy&#39;s statement.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two clues that this is not the right way to describe the age of the fossilized dinosaur bone. First, when large numbers are reported as round numbers (like 90 million), then it is almost always the case that it is reported to the nearest 10 million (or possibly to the nearest 1 million). Second, even if we thought that it was possible that the 90 million figure is an exact figure, the age of fossilized dinosaur bones cannot be determined to that level of precision.</p>

<p>In any case, 90 million is not reported to the nearest ten years. When we say that, &quot;The dinosaur bones are 90 million years old,&quot; we might more precisely mean something like, &quot;The dinosaur bones are 90 million years old, plus or minus five million years.&quot; Adding 20 more years has a negligible effect on our estimate of their age.</p>

<p>Here is Henrietta&#39;s explanation for why $4^{3/2} = 8$:</p>

<blockquote>I know that $\sqrt{4}=2$ and the cube of 2 is 8.</blockquote>

<p>a. Are Henry and Henrietta correct? Explain.</p>

<p>c. Use both Henry and Henrietta&#39;s reasoning to express $x^{m/n}$ using radicals (here $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and we assume $x&gt;0$).</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. Henry&#39;s reasoning is correct. We can show this with equations:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 4^{3/2} &amp;= (4^3)^{1/2} \\ &amp;= \sqrt{4^3} \\ &amp;= \sqrt{64} \\ &amp;= 8. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>The first equation is true because $\left(4^{3/2}\right)^2 = 4^{2 \times 3/2} = 4^3$ and $\sqrt{4^3}$ is the only positive number whose square is $4^3$. We can also reverse the series of equalities, starting with the right hand side and manipulating to obtain the left hand side:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 8 &amp;= \sqrt{64}\\ &amp;= \sqrt{4^3 }\\ &amp;= 4^{3/2} \end{align} $$</div>

<p>with the last equality coming from the fact that $4^{3/2}$ and $\sqrt{4^3}$ are both the only positive number whose square is 64. In all of the series of equalities that follow in the solution, students can similarly reverse the order.</p>

<p>Henrietta&#39;s reasoning is also correct. We can show this with equations:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 4^{3/2} &amp;= (4^{1/2})^3 \\ &amp;= (\sqrt{4})^3 \\ &amp;= 2^3 \\ &amp;= 8. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>The first equation is again true because because both sides are positive with the same square.</p>

<p>b. Henry&#39;s reasoning can be adapted to find $4^{5/2}$ as follows:</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 4^{5/2} &amp;= \sqrt{4^5} \\ &amp;= \sqrt{1024} \\ &amp;= 32. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>Alternatively, knowing that $4^{3/2} = 8$, we could reason that</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 4^{5/2} &amp;= 4^{3/2} \times 4 \\ &amp;= 8 \times 4 \\ &amp;= 32. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>Using Henrietta&#39;s reasoning to find $4^{5/2}$, we have</p>

<div>$$ \begin{align} 4^{5/2} &amp;= (\sqrt{4})^5 \\ &amp;= 2^5 \\ &amp;= 32. \end{align} $$</div>

<p>c. Applied to $x^{m/n}$, Henry&#39;s idea is to first find $x^m$ and then extract the $n^{\rm th}$ root: $$ x^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{x^{m}}. $$</p>

<p>The equation is true because the $n^{\rm th}$ power of both sides is equal to $x^m$: since both sides are positive when $n$ is even, this means that both sides of the equation are equal.</p>

<p>Henrietta&#39;s idea is to first take the $n^{\rm th}$ root of $x$ and then raise this to the $m^{\rm th}$ power:</p>

<p>$$ x^{m/n} = \left(\sqrt[n]{x}\right)^m. $$</p>

<p>The equation is also true because the $n^{\rm th}$ power of both sides is equal to $x^m$.</p>

<p>Find some hand calculations which show that, as Zara says, $3^{1.4}$ must be less than $6$.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p>Solution: Series of inequalities</p>

<p>Because $1.4 &lt; 1.5$, we know $3^{1.4} &lt; 3^{1.5} = 3^{\frac{3}{2}}$.</p>

<p>Because $3^{\frac{3}{2}} = \sqrt{27}$, we know that it is less than $\sqrt{36} = 6$.</p>

<p>In summary, $3^{1.4} &lt; 3^{1.5} &lt; (3^{3})^{\frac{1}{2}} = 27^{\frac{1}{2}} &lt; 36^{\frac{1}{2}} = 6.$</p>

<p>We can summarize these on the number line as follows.</p>

<p><img alt=""1220_number_line_3920a2e9760296d3bd717b45e282f50e"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/730/max/1220_number_line_3920a2e9760296d3bd717b45e282f50e.jpg?1356155106"" /></p>

<p>Solution: Second series of inequalities</p>

<p>Since $\sqrt{3}&lt;\sqrt{4}=2$, we have $3^{1.5}=3 \cdot \sqrt{3} &lt; 3 \cdot 2$. Thus</p>

<p>$$ 3^{1.4} &lt; 3^{1.5} &lt; 3 \times 2 = 6. $$</p>

<p>We can summarize these on the number line (with the same points as in the previous problem but with different labels) as follows.</p>

<p>Solution: Carefully &quot;working backwards&quot; from the inequality we want to show.</p>

<p>To show $3^{1.4}&lt; 6$ means to show $3^{\frac{14}{10}} &lt; 6$. This would follow by taking the inequality $3^{14} &lt; 6^{10}$ and raising it to the $\frac{1}{10}$ power (that is, taking the &quot;tenth root&quot;). Since this inequality is in turn be the square of the inequality $3^7 &lt; 6^5$, it suffices to show this easier inequality. By hand or rudimentary calculator we compute that $3^7 = 2187$ and $6^5 = 7776$, so indeed $3^7$ is less than $6^5$. By the reasoning given so far, we can now deduce that $3^{1.4} &lt; 6$. Alternately in the end, once we see that $3^7 &lt; 6^5$, we can take the fifth root of both sides to see the desired inequality.</p>

</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Suppose $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$ are two fractions. This means that $b$ and $d$ are non-zero integers and $a$ and $c$ are integers. We can calculate the sum by finding a common denominator: $$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}. $$ Since $b$ and $d$ are not zero, the denominator $bd$ is not zero. Moreover, sums and products of integers are integers so both the numerator $ad + bc$ and the denominator $bd$ are integers. This means that the sum $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}$ is a rational number.</p>

	<p>The same argument works for the product and is quicker: $$ \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}. $$ Since $b$ and $d$ are not zero, the denominator $bd$ is not zero. Products of integers are integers so the numerator $ac$ and the denominator $bd$ are both integers and the product $\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d}$ is a rational number.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The number $x = \pi + \frac{1}{7}$ is either rational or irrational. If $x$ were rational then from part (a) $x - \frac{1}{7}$ would also be rational. But $x - \frac{1}{7} = \pi$ is not rational. Since $x$ is not rational it must be irrational.</p>

	<p>A similar argument shows that $x = \pi \times \frac{1}{7}$ is irrational. Again, $x$ is either rational or irrational. If $x$ were rational then $7x$ would also be rational but $7x = \pi$ is irrational. So $x$ must be irrational.</p>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<ol>
		<li>The probability of the passenger being in first class is the number of all first class passengers divided by total number of passengers , that is $P(\text{passenger being in first class}) = \frac{324}{1317} \approx 0.246$</li>
		<li>The probability that the passenger survived is the number of all passengers who survived divided by total number of passengers, that is $P(\text{passenger survived}) = \frac{500}{1317} \approx 0.380$</li>
		<li>This is the fraction of all passengers that are both in first class and survived, which is $P[\text{(passenger was in first class) and (passenger survived)}] = \frac{201}{1317} \approx 0.153$</li>
		<li>This is a conditional probability. To find the probability that the passenger survived, given this passenger was in first class, we calculate the fraction of first class passenger who survived, that is $P(\text{passenger survived} | \text{passenger was in first class}) = \frac{201}{324} \approx 0.620$.</li>
		<li>This is a conditional probability: $P(\text{passenger was in first class} | \text{passenger survived})$. We can calculate it as the fraction of surviving passengers who were in first class, which is $\frac{201}{500} \approx 0.402$</li>
		<li>This is a conditional probability: $P(\text{passenger was in third class} | \text{passenger survived})$. We can calculate it as the fraction of surviving passengers who were in third class, which is $\frac{181}{500} \approx 0.362$</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Even though in both parts (a.iii) and (a.iv) we have the same numerator (201), in part (a.iii) the sample space consists of all the passengers, but in part (a.iv) the sample space is restricted to only the first class passengers. Since in part (a.iv) we divide by a smaller number, the answer in part (a.iv) is larger than in part (a.iii).</li>
	<li>In both parts (a.v) and (a.vi) the sample space is restricted to all the passengers who survived. But since among that group there were more first class than third class passengers, the answer to part (a.v) is larger than the answer to part (a.vi).</li>
	<li>
	<p>There are many questions that can be answered using the given table. Possible answers may include, but are not limited, to the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>If one of the passengers is randomly selected, what is the probability that this passenger was in second class?</p>

		<p>Answer: $P(\text{passenger was in second class})= \frac{284}{1317} \approx 0.216$.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>If one of the passengers is randomly selected, what is the probability that this passenger was in second class and survived?</p>

		<p>Answer: $P[\text{(passenger was in second class) and (passenger survived)}]= \frac{118}{1317} \approx 0.090.$.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>If one of the passengers is randomly selected from among the second class passengers, what is the probability that this passenger survived?</p>

		<p>Answer: $P(\text{passenger survived | passenger was in second class}) = \frac{118}{284} \approx 0.415$.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>If one of the passengers who survived is randomly selected, what is the probability that this passenger was in second class?</p>

		<p>Answer: $P(\text{passenger was in second class | passenger survived}) = \frac{118}{500} \approx 0.236$.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a.</p>

<p>Each student is represented by a dot in the&nbsp;diagram, so there are 20 students on the council.</p>

<p>b.</p>

<p>The probability that student K is selected is 1/20 = 0.05 because there are 20 possible outcomes and the outcomes are equally likely. Only one of these outcomes corresponds to student K being selected.</p>

<p>c.</p>

<p>Diagram 2 could be a representation of these three events. Diagram 1 is not possible, because two outcomes (M and N) are in both events <em>J</em> and <em>S</em>. Since it is impossible for a student to be both a junior and a senior, diagram 1 could not be correct for the three events given.</p>

<p>d.</p>

<p>Because there are 7 outcomes in this event and the outcomes are equally likely, <em>P(J)</em> = 7/20 = 0.35.</p>

<p>e.</p>

<p>No, <em>P(F)</em> = 2/20 = .10. The number of outcomes is not the same for these two events.</p>

<p>f.</p>

<p>a.<em>P(F)</em> = 2/20 = 0.10<br />
b.<em>P(S)</em> = 6/20 = 0.30<br />
c.<em>P(F or S) </em>= 8/20 = 0.40</p>

<p>g.</p>

<p>The region where the two ovals overlap corresponds to the event that the selected student is both male and a junior.</p>

<p>h.</p>

<p>a.<em>P(J)</em> = 7/20 = 0.35<br />
b.<em>P(M)</em> = 6/20 = 0.30<br />
c.<em>P(J or M)</em> = 11/20 = 0.55<br />
d.<em>P(J and M)</em> = 2/20 = 0.10</p>

<p>i.</p>

<p>The events <em>F</em> and <em>S</em> do not have any outcomes in common, so the total number of outcomes in the union is just the sum of the number of outcomes in the two individual events. The events <em>J</em> and <em>M</em> do have outcomes in common, so if you add the number of outcomes in the two individual events, you would count some outcomes twice.</p>

<p><em>j.</em></p>

<p><em>P(J or M) = P(J) +P(M) &ndash; P(J and M)</em></p>

<p><em>k.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>If you add the probabilities <em>P(J) +P(M)</em>, the probability of outcomes that are in both <em>J</em> and <em>M</em> is included twice&mdash;once as a part of <em>P(J)</em> and once and part of <em>P(M)</em>. Subtracting out <em>P(J and M)</em> corrects for this double counting.</p>

<p>l.</p>

<p>Case 1: <em>P(A or B) = P(A) +P(B)</em><br />
Case 2:<em>P(A or B) = P(A) +P(B) &ndash; P(A and B)</em></p>

<p><em>m.</em></p>

<p>The Case 2 formula would also work for events that are mutually exclusive, because for events that are mutually exclusive there would be no overlap and <em>P(A and B)</em> = 0.</p>

<p>n.</p>

<p>If two events are mutually exclusive, you can calculate the probability of their union by just adding the individual event probabilities. If two events are not mutually exclusive, you can calculate the probability of the union by adding the individual event probabilities and then subtracting the probability of the intersection of the two events.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A certain test for mononucleosis has a 99% chance of correctly diagnosing a patient with mononucleosis and a 5% chance of misdiagnosing a patient who does not have the infection. Suppose the test is given to a group where 1% of the people have mononucleosis. If a randomly selected patient&#39;s test result is positive, what is the probability that she has mononucleosis? Explain.</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 1 Making a table </span></p>

<p>Imagine the test is given to 10,000 people, 1% of whom actually have mono. Then 100 people have it and 9,900 people do not. Of the 100 people who have it, 99% will test positive and 1% will test negative. Of the 9,900 people who <em> do not </em> have it, 5% will test positive and 95% will test negative. The table below summarizes this information:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>&nbsp;</th>
			<th>Test is positive</th>
			<th>Test is negative</th>
			<th>Total number of people</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Have mono</th>
			<td>99</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>100</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Do not have mono</th>
			<td>495</td>
			<td>9,405</td>
			<td>9,900</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Total number of people</th>
			<td>594</td>
			<td>9,406</td>
			<td>10,000</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>So 594 people test positive, but only 99 of them actually have mono. Thus about $\frac{99}{594}\approx 0.167$ or 17% of the people who test positive for mono actually have the disease.</p>

<p>Note that all of the numbers in the table are proportional to 10,000, the hypothetical size of the sample. If the sample size changes, the numbers will change but their ratios remain the same. For example, if 20,000 people were tested, all numbers in the table would double and so the fraction $\frac{99}{594}$ would be multiplied by $\frac{2}{2}$, leaving the value the same. So we can see that our predicted answer of 17% does not depend on the size of the sample (as long as the sample is large).</p>

<p><span class=""unit"">Solution: 2 Using Probability Rules (S.CP.8) </span></p>

<p>Here we let $A$ be the outcome &#39;&#39;the patient has mononucleosis&#39;&#39; and $B$ the outcome &#39;&#39;the patient tests positive for mononucleosis.&#39;&#39; The problem is asking to calculate $P(A|B)$, the probability that the patient has mononucleosis <em> assuming </em> the test result came back positive. We have the formula $$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}. $$ Now for the terms on the right hand side of the equation, we are given that $P(B|A) = 0.99$: if a patient has mononucleosis, the test result will come back positive in 99% of the cases. We are also given $P(A) = 0.01$ since 1% of the population has mononucleosis. To find $P(B)$ we let $x$ denote the size of the sample, that is the number of people tested for mononucleosis. Then $$ P(B) = \frac{0.99 \times 0.01x + 0.05 \times 0.99x}{x}. $$ In this expression, $0.01x$ denotes the number of people with mono and $0.99x$ is the number of this group who test positive. Similarly for $0.05 \times 0.99x$, the $0.99x$ term is the number of people who do not have mono and multiplying by 0.05 gives the number from this group who test positive. So the numerator is the total number of people who test positive and the denominator is the number of people in the sample. The $x$&#39;s cancel out giving $$ P(B) = \frac{0.99 \times 0.01 + 0.05 \times 0.99}{1} $$ Putting all of our information together we have</p>

<div>\begin{align} P(A|B) &amp;= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\\ &amp;= \frac{0.99 \times 0.01}{\left(\frac{0.99 \times 0.01 + 0.05 \times 0.99}{1}\right)}\\ &amp;\approx 17\%. \end{align}</div>

<p>The fact that the $x$&#39;s cancel out when we calculate $P(B)$ indicates that this probability does not depend on the sample size. In practice, however, if the sample size is too small, then an experimental value found by testing people in a study could differ substantially from this estimate. The larger the sample size, the closer experimental and theoretical probabilities should be.</p>

","<h1>Alex, Mel, and Chelsea Play a Game</h1>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Alex, Mel, and Chelsea play a game that has 6 rounds. In each round there is a single winner, and the outcomes of the rounds are independent. For each round the probability that Alex wins is $\frac{1}{2}$, and Mel is twice as likely to win as Chelsea. What is the probability that Alex wins three rounds, Mel wins two rounds, and Chelsea wins one round?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>There are three separate steps to this problem. We need to calculate the probabilities that Mel and Chelsea win a single round. Next, we must compute the probability of any given scenario where Alex wins 3 rounds, Mel wins 2, and Chelsea wins 1 round. Then we have to find out how many ways there are for Alex to win three rounds, Mel 2, and Chelsea 1. With all of this information we can then calculate the probability that Alex wins 3 rounds, Mel wins 2, and Chelsea wins 1.</p>

<p>We are given that Mel is twice as likely to win a round as Chelsea. Their combined probability of winning a round is $\frac{1}{2}$ since this number, combined with Alex&#39;s probability of winning a round, must add up to 1. If we let $x$ denote Chelsea&#39;s probability of winning a given round then $2x$ is Mel&#39;s probability of winning a round and</p>

<p>$$ 2x + x = \frac{1}{2} $$ so $x = \frac{1}{6}$.</p>

<p>So the probability that Mel wins a round is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$ and the probability that Chelsea wins a round is $\frac{1}{6}$.</p>

<p>Suppose we let AAAMMC denote the situation where Alex wins the first three rounds, Mel wins the fourth and fifth, and Chelsea wins the sixth. To find the likelihood that this happens, we use the information from the previous paragraph about the probability that each individual wins a single round. So the probability that Alex wins the first round is $\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly the probability that Alex wins round 2 is $\frac{1}{2}$ as is the probability that he wins round 3. The probability that Mel wins round 4 is $\frac{1}{3}$ and so is the probability that Mel wins round 5. Finally the probability that Chelsea wins round 6 is $\frac{1}{6}$. Since the different rounds are independent events, this means that the probability of an outcome such as AAAMMC (with three wins for Alex, two wins for Mel and one win for Chelsea) is</p>

<p>$$ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 \times \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) $$</p>

<p>This is the same as the probability of, say, MMAAAC, where Mel wins the first two rounds, Alex the next three, and Chelsea the final one. This brings us to our last step, finding out how many ways there are for Alex to win 3 rounds, Mel 2 and Chelsea 1.</p>

<p>Since there are six rounds, the number of ways Alex can win 3 of them is the combinatorial symbol</p>

<div>$$ \left( \begin{array} &amp;6 \\ 3 \end{array} \right) $$</div>

<p>which is equal to 20. Once the three games which Alex has won have been chosen, Mel must win two of the other three and there are</p>

<div>$$ \left( \begin{array} &amp;3 \\ 2 \end{array} \right) $$</div>

<p>for this to happen: this is equal to 3. The remaining game, won by Chelsea, has no further choices.</p>

<p>Putting together all of this information, the probability that Alex wins three games, Mel two, and Chelsea one is</p>

<p>$$ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 \times \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 20 \times 3 = \frac{5}{36}. $$</p>

<p>The judgment sampling distribution has a mean of 10.14, while the random sampling distribution has a mean of 7.39. (The actual population mean is 7.4.) The judgment samples tend to contain more of the larger rectangles, perhaps because the eye is drawn to them more easily.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many researchers have studied chimpanzees to learn about their problem solving skills. In 1978, researchers Premack and Woodruff published an article in Science magazine, reporting findings from a study on an adult chimpanzee named Sarah, who had been raised in captivity and had received extensive training using photos and symbols. In one experiment, Sarah was shown videotapes of eight different situations in which a human being was faced with a problem. After each videotape showing, Sarah was presented with two photographs, one of which depicted a possible solution to the problem. The researchers ensured that the order in which the photographs were presented was randomized (for example, the correct answer was not always presented first, etc.) and that the photographs had similar visuals (for example. similar colors, etc.) Of the eight problems, Sarah picked the photograph with the correct solution seven times. Could Sarah have been merely guessing and just lucky with her responses, or is there evidence that Sarah does better than just guessing?</p>

<ol>
	<li>Give two <em>possible</em> explanations for why Sarah might have answered seven out of eight correctly.</li>
	<li>If Sarah were just guessing, and was just likely to pick one photograph compared to the other, how many would you expect her to get right out of eight problems?</li>
	<li>Give an example of how you could use basic classroom tools (coins, dice, calculators, cards, etc.) to simulate one trial of Sarah &ldquo;just guessing&rdquo; to pick a photograph for one problem.</li>
	<li>A student, James, decides to use simulation to investigate whether the study data provide evidence that Sarah was doing better than just randomly guessing, and so James tosses a coin eight times, and obtains six heads. Explain why James should repeat the process of tossing the coin eight times and recording the number of heads, many times.</li>

	<p>James repeats the process of eight coin-tosses 100 times, each time recording the number of heads on the eight coin-tosses. The following is a dotplot of his results.</p>

	<li>Most common outcome is 4 - which makes sense because that is what we expect would happen if Sarah was randomly picking a photograph.</li>
	<li>7 is unusual (surprising) because on the 100 tosses, an outcome as or more extreme as 7 happened by chance only 4 times.</li>
	<li>(iii) Both (i) and (i) are possible explanations</li>
	<li>(ii) Sarah does better than just guessing.</li>

<p>i. What is a reasonable estimate of the margin of error for samples of size 20? For samples of size 40? For samples of size 100?</p>

<p>j. How is the margin of error related to sample size?</p>

<p>In practice, we don&rsquo;t take many random samples from a population and we don&rsquo;t know the actual value of the population mean, so we need a way to estimate the margin of error from a single sample.</p>

<p>An estimate of the margin of error based on a single random sample can be obtained by evaluating the following expression</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; estimated margin of error = \(2 {s \over \sqrt{n}}\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>where <em>s</em> is the sample standard deviation and <em>n</em> is the sample size.</p>

<p>k. Using the sample at the beginning of this activity, what is&nbsp;the estimated margin of error?</p>

<p>l. Suppose that a random sample of 50 healthy adults resulted in a sample mean body temperature of \( \overline{x} = 98.2\)&nbsp;degrees and a sample standard deviation of <em>s</em> = 0.65 degrees. Would you consider this evidence that the actual mean temperature for healthy adults is in fact less than 98.6 degrees? (Hint: what is the estimated margin of error?)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. 98.78 degrees</p>

<p>b. No. The value of the sample mean will vary from sample to sample because different samples will include different individuals from the population.</p>

<p>c. 25</p>

<p>d. No. Many of the 100 random samples resulted in a sample mean that was 98.8 or greater. This would not be surprising.</p>

<p>e. Statement 3 (although some students may say Statement 2, depending on how they interpret &ldquo;most&rdquo;).</p>

<p>f. Only 9 of the 100 samples had sample means that were farther from 98.6 degrees&nbsp;than 0.45 degrees. This means that 91 of the 100 random samples resulted in a sample mean that was closer to the actual value of the population mean than 0.45 degrees. It would be unlikely to get a random sample of size 10 that had a sample mean farther away from the population mean than 0.45 degrees.</p>

<p>g. Would expect it to be closer because the sample size of 20 is larger than the sample size 10. This would mean that we expect the margin of error to be smaller.</p>

<p>h. Most of the samples of size 20 were within about 0.25 degrees&nbsp;of the actual value of the population mean. This is smaller than 0.45 degrees.</p>

<p>i. Answers will vary, but one set of reasonable answers is 0.45, 0.25, 0.20, and 0.15 degrees.</p>

<p>j. The greater the sample size, the smaller the value of the margin of error.</p>

<p>k. The sample&nbsp;standard deviation is&nbsp;0.62 degrees. The estimated margin of error is then&nbsp;estimated margin of error =&nbsp; \(2 {s \over \sqrt{n}} = 2{(0.62) \over \sqrt{10}} = 0.392\)&nbsp;degrees</p>

<p>l. For a sample of size 50,&nbsp;estimated margin of error =&nbsp; \(2 {s \over \sqrt{n}} = 2{(0.65) \over \sqrt{50}} = 0.184\)&nbsp;degrees<br />
<br />
This means that it would be unlikely to get a sample mean that is farther from the actual population mean than 0.184 degrees. The sample mean of 98.2 degrees is 0.4 degrees away from 98.6 degrees, so it seems unlikely that the actual population mean could have been 98.6 degrees.</p>

An example of such a task is outlined in the commentary that follows. Suppose a student attempts to answer the question, &quot;Will 50% of the homeowners in your neighborhood agree to support a proposed new tax for schools?&rdquo; by taking a] random sample of 50 homeowners in her neighborhood and asking them if they support the tax. Twenty of the sampled homeowners say they will support the proposed tax, yielding a sample proportion of 20/50 = 0.4. That seems like bad news for the schools, but could the population proportion favoring the tax in this neighborhood still be 50%? The student knows that a second sample of 50 homeowners might produce a different sample proportion and wonders how much variation there might be among sample proportions for samples of size 50 if, in fact, 50% is the true population proportion. Having a graphing calculator available, she simulates this sampling situation by repeatedly drawing random samples of size 50 from a population of 50% ones and 50% zeros, calculating and plotting the proportion of ones observed in each sample. The result for 200 trials is displayed in the margin. The simulated values at or below the observed 0.4 number 25 out of 200, or 25/200 = 0.125. So, the chance of seeing a 40% or fewer favorable response in the sample even if the true proportion of such responses was 50% is not all that small, casting little doubt on 50% as a plausible population value. Relating the components of this example to the statistical reasoning process, students see that the hypothesis is that the population parameter is 50% and the data are collected by a random sample. The observed sample proportion of 40% was found to be not so far from the 50% so as to cause serious doubt about the hypothesis. This lack of doubt was justified by simulating the sampling process many times and approximating the chance of a sample proportion being 40% or less under the hypothesis, [thereby engaging in Standard for Mathematical Practice 8.] Students now realize that there are other plausible values for the population proportion, besides 50%. The plot of the distribution of sample proportions in the margin is mound-shaped (approximately normal) and somewhat symmetric with a mean of about 0.49 (close to 0.50) and a standard deviation of about 0.07. From knowledge of the normal distribution, students knows that about 95% of the possible sample proportions that could be generated this way will fall within two standard deviations of the mean. This two standard deviation distance is called the margin of error for the sample proportions. In this example with samples of size 50, the margin of error is 2* 0.07 = 0.14. Suppose the true population proportion is 0.60. The distribution of the sample proportions will still look much like the plot in the margin, but the center of the distribution will be at 0.60. In this case, the observed sample proportion 0.4 will not be within the margin of error. Reasoning this way leads the student to realize that any population proportion in the interval 0.40 +/_ 0.14 will result in the observed sample proportion of 0.40 being within the middle 95% of the distribution of sample proportions, for samples of size 50. Thus, the interval observed sample proportion +/-margin of error includes the plausible values for the true population proportion in the sense that any of those populations would have produced the observed sample proportion within its middle 95% of possible outcomes. In other words, the student is confident that the proportion of homeowners in her neighborhood that will favor the tax is between 0.26 and 0.54.</p>

<p>b. How would you describe the difference in haircut costs between males and females? Be sure you discuss differences/similarities in shape, center and spread.</p>

<p>c. Why is the mean greater than the median both for males and for females? Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p>d. Is the median or mean a more appropriate choice for describing the &ldquo;centers&rdquo; of these two distributions?</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a.&nbsp; Students can sketch out a basic box plot with whiskers extending to the min and max, a box extending from the first quartile to the third quartile, and a line at the median, as shown below. In order to compare haircut costs of males and females, the two boxplots should be plotted side by side on the same scale.</p>

<p><img alt=""Sol_1_fff0250e2e5117912bcd546995721b15"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/001/432/max/Sol_1_fff0250e2e5117912bcd546995721b15.jpg?1346621637"" /></p>

<p>b. Both boxplots show distributions that are skewed to the right. It makes sense that most haircuts will not cost too much, but a few students will spend a large amount. Since the cost will always be a positive number, the minimum cannot be less than 0 and there is a long right tail. The centers and spreads are quite different. The median cost for females is about twice that of males, and there is much more variability in the haircut costs for women. The interquartile range (IQR) for women is \$55, while for men it is \$10.75.</p>

<p>c. We should not be surprised that the mean is larger than the median because the distribution appears to be skewed to the right. The mean averages all the values in the data, so is &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; toward the high ones. The median is the 50th percentile and is resistant to the extreme values.</p>

<p>d. Since the median gives a better description of the center, or a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; haircut cost, it is more appropriate. Note that the mean for males is about equal to the 3rd quartile, indicating that 75% of the males paid less than the mean haircut cost for males. For women, the median is \$31, indicating that half of women spent \$31 or less, but the mean haircut cost for women is \$52.53. The mean doesn&rsquo;t give us a good idea of what we could expect for a typical student&#39;s haircut cost. It is best to only use the mean when the data distribution is reasonably symmetric.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. The standard deviation is a measure of spread about the mean and is defined as</p>

<p>&nbsp;Standard Deviation =&nbsp;\(\sqrt{{1 \over{n-1}} \sum {{(x - \bar{x})}^2}}\)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;MAD =&nbsp;\({1 \over{n}} \sum {{ |x - \bar{x}|}}\)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While both measures rely on the deviations from the mean (\(x - \bar{x}\)), the MAD uses the absolute values of the deviations and the standard deviation uses the squares of the deviations. Both methods result in non-negative differences. The MAD is simply the mean of these nonnegative (absolute) deviations. The standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squares of the deviations, divided by (<em>n</em>-1). This measure also results in a value that in some sense represents the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; difference between each data point and the mean.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; To calculate the standard deviation, we must first find the mean of the test scores. \(\bar{x} = {{92+84+96+100} \over {4}} = {{372} \over {4}} = 93\). Then, we find the deviations from the mean, find the sum of the squares of the deviations, divide by one less than the number of scores and take the square root of the result.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Sally&rsquo;s scores and Jim&rsquo;s scored both have a mean score of 93. Since Sally&rsquo;s scores are clustered more closely around 93 than Jim&rsquo;s scores, Sally&rsquo;s scores are less variable and the standard deviation of her scores will be smaller than the standard deviation of Jim&rsquo;s scores.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; In order for the standard deviation to be zero, all scores must be the same. So Tom must have scored 91 on all four exams.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Some students may say yes and others may say no. Which ever answer the student gives should be justified. A student who thinks John&rsquo;s distance is unusual may justify it by saying that the John&rsquo;s data point is at the far right and that the right whisker is relatively long. A student who says his distance is not unusual may justify it by saying that the right whisker is not &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; long or by saying that the shortest distance (Zane&rsquo;s) is not unusual and John&rsquo;s distance from the median is not much larger than Zane&rsquo;s distance from the median. The purpose of this question is to motivate the need for a more objective definition of an outlier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mean has increased and the median is unchanged. The mean has increased because it is calculated by taking the sum of all of the distances and dividing by 13. Since John&rsquo;s distance has increased, the sum of all distances will increase and will cause the mean to also increase. Since the median is simply the middle value in a sorted list of distances, it remains unchanged, as John is still the student who lives furthest from school.</p>

<p>Most students will agree that John is now an &ldquo;outlier&rdquo;. They should be using the length of the right whisker relative to the rest of the boxplot to justify their choice.</p>

Q3 = 1.5(IQR) = 4.3 + 1.5(4.3 - 1.0) = 4.3 + 4.95 = 9.25</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the move, John&rsquo;s distance is not considered an outlier since 7.0 is less than 9.25. After the move, his distance in greater than 9.25, and now considered an outlier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: The value&nbsp;Q3 + 1.5(IQR) is often referred to as the &quot;upper fence&quot;. When asked why he decided on the scalar 1.5, John Tukey replied, &ldquo;1.0 was too small and 2.0 was too big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; The lower boundary for outliers is<br />
Q3 + 1.5(IQR) = 0.4 - 1.5(4.3 - 1.0) = 0.4 - 4.95 = -4.55</p>

	<li>The boundary values occur one standard deviation above and below the mean respectively. Therefore, it would be acceptable for students to answer &ldquo;68%&rdquo; based on the Empirical Rule and given that the term &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; appears in the question. Also, students could use technology to obtain a more precise value of .6827 or a standard normal table to obtain an answer of .6826. If the table method is used, students would need to recognize that the boundary values have z-scores of -1 and 1 respectively.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Somewhere in the body of the memo, it should be clearly stated that yes, Fred should get a certificate. Multiple analysis methods to support this are available; the student need only present one in a clear fashion.</p>

	<p>Supportive analysis statements include:</p>

	<p>By Empirical Rule, the top 2.5% of this normal distribution would be scores above 12.94 (2 standard deviations above the mean). Fred&#39;s score is greater than 12.94, thus he is in the top 2.5% and should get a certificate.</p>

	<p>For the given normal distribution, the top 2.5% would be scores above 12.87 (1.96 standard deviations above the mean). Fred&#39;s score is greater than 12.87, thus he is in the top 2.5% and should get a certificate.</p>

	<p>Fred&#39;s score of 13.1 is 2.09 standard deviations above the mean. The top 2.5% of scores are any scores that are at least 1.96 standard deviations above the mean, thus he is in the top 2.5% and should get a certificate.</p>

	<p>Fred&#39;s score of 13.1 is 2.09 standard deviations above the mean. That puts him in the top 1.8% of scores, so yes, he should get a certificate.</p>

Instead, the aim is to look for broad approximations, with application of the rather rough &ldquo;empirical rule&rdquo; (also called the 68%&ndash;95% Rule) for distributions that are somewhat bell-shaped. The better the bell, the better the approximation. Using such approximations is partial justification for the introduction of the standard deviation.<br />

<p>The answers for questions&nbsp;f &ndash;&nbsp;h will vary depending on what events that the student defines. Check to make sure that students have given a correct description of the union and the intersection for the two events that they defined. In question 8, it might be possible for students to define two events for which both the union and the intersection are the same, but this would not usually be the case.

</ol>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>The data in the scatterplot are from two quantitative variables (year and finishing time), and the overall pattern is linear. There are also no obvious outliers, so it is reasonable to fit a linear model to the data. The direction of the association is negative (finishing time decreases as the year after 1900 increases), and the association is strong because the points are tightly clustered in a linear form.</li>
	<li>The slope of the&nbsp;equation of the line of best fit&nbsp;is $-0.0106.$ This means for every 1 year that passes, we would predict that the finishing time for the 100-m dash decreases by $0.0106$ seconds. Since the Olympics take place every four years, we would expect the predicted gold medalist&#39;s finishing time to decrease by $4(0.0106) = 0.0424$ seconds from one Olympic games to the next.</li>
	<li>The vertical intercept of the&nbsp;line of best fit&#39;s&nbsp;equation is 10.878. In context, this would be the predicted finishing time (in seconds) for the 100-m dash gold medalist in the 1900 Olympic games.</li>
	<li>To predict the finishing time for the 1940 gold medalist, we would simply substitute $\mbox{Years after 1900} = 40$ into the&nbsp;equation of the line of best fit&nbsp;to solve for $\widehat{\mbox{Finishing Time}}.$ This yields $$ \widehat{\mbox{Finishing Time}} = 10.878 - 0.0106 (40) = 10.454.$$ The predicted finishing time for the 1940 gold medalist is 10.454 seconds.</li>
	<li>At the most basic level, we know that the model will fail to be realistic once we obtain predicted racing times of zero or less. Substituting $0$ into the equation for $\widehat{\mbox{Finishing Time}}$, we can solve for $\mbox{Years after 1900} \approx 1026.2.$ This equates to roughly the year 2926. If we take into account the current four-year rotation for the summer Olympic games, however, we see that the model will only provide a positive prediction up through the Olympic games in the year 2924. To be even more realistic, we should expect any 100-m dash to be completed in some positive amount of time; however, it may be difficult for students to put a specific value on a reasonable result. This discussion could also open up the topic of extrapolation versus interpolation when using linear&nbsp;models.</li>

A careful look at the scatter plot reveals some curvature in the pattern,which is more obvious in the residual plot, because the older and larger trees add to the diameter more slowly.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Each additional person added to the party adds approximately $11.15 to the bill.</p>

<p>e.&nbsp; This variability can be explained by differences in what the parties ordered to eat or drink. For example, we would not expect one party of 5 people to order food that costs exactly the same as every other party of 5 people.</p>

<p>a. When can Jerry expect that his laptop battery is fully charged?</p>

<p>b. At 9:27 AM Jerry makes a quick calculation:</p>

<p>Explain Jerry&#39;s calculation. Is his estimate most likely an under- or over-estimate? How does it compare to your prediction?</p>

<p>c. Compare the average rate of change of the battery charging function on the first given time interval and on the last given time interval. What does this tell you about how the battery is charging?</p>

<p>a. In this situation we are looking at two variables: time, $t$ and battery charge, $b$. There are several ways we can choose units. A reasonable choice is &quot;time in minutes since the laptop was plugged in&quot; and &quot;battery charge in percentage of full, %&quot;</p>

<p>The laptop started charging at 9:11 a.m. and it was initially 41% charged. If we let $t$ be time since the laptop was plugged in, this information corresponds to the point with coordinates $(0,41).$ Similarly, we can translate the other screenshots into coordinate points: $(16, 56),\ (25, 64),\ (37, 74),\ (44, 79),\ (57, 86),\ (66, 91)$.</p>

<p>We can now make a scatter plot of the data to get an idea how the two variables are related.</p>

<p><img alt=""Scatter_plot_8d10bf16afb894892979b0d36ea3a834"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/514/large/scatter_plot_8d10bf16afb894892979b0d36ea3a834.jpg?1372268876"" /></p>

<p>It looks like there is a linear relationship between the variables.</p>

<p><img alt=""Line_only_898c41c1c358806075bda2d704fac93e"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/516/large/line_only_898c41c1c358806075bda2d704fac93e.jpg?1372269064"" /></p>

<p>Using technology such as a graphing calculator or WolframAlpha we find that $b=43.7+0.757t.$</p>

<p>We can extend the line of best fit and see at what time it will reach an output value of 100%. This happens about 75 minutes after the computer was plugged in.</p>

<p><img alt=""Line_2f41b739ceacf74ff9265f6ecbc088af"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/515/large/line_2f41b739ceacf74ff9265f6ecbc088af.jpg?1372268912"" /></p>

<p>We can also use the equation to solve $b=43.7+0.757t=100$ for $t$ to obtain $t\approx 74.5$ minutes.</p>

<p>b. At 9:27 a.m. Jerry has two data points: $(0,41)$ and $(16,56)$. So the battery charged 15 percentage points in 16 minutes. That is almost 1 percentage point per minute. At 9:27 a.m. the battery still needs to charge 44 more percentage points, which will take approximately 44 minutes. So 44 minutes after 9:27 a.m. puts us at 10:11 a.m.</p>

<p>Jerry&#39;s estimate will probably be an underestimate for the time needed to fully charge the battery. He is overestimating the rate at which the battery is charging. Therefore, his calculation comes up with a shorter amount of time than is actually needed.</p>

<p>We can visualize Jerry&#39;s method with a line of slope 1 through the point $(16,56)$.</p>

<p><img alt=""Jerrys_estimate_1b0cc4060733776cf9082a27d0aa88af"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/519/large/Jerrys_estimate_1b0cc4060733776cf9082a27d0aa88af.jpg?1372481045"" /></p>

<p>c. The average rate of change of the battery charging function during the first time interval is $\displaystyle\frac{56-41}{16-0}=\frac{15}{16}=0.9375$ percentage points per minute. During the last time interval the average rate of change is $\displaystyle\frac{91 - 86}{66 - 57}=\frac{5}{9}\approx 0.556$ percentage points per minute. This means that as the battery gets charged, the rate at which it charges is going down. So it will take longer to go from 90% to 100% than it took to get from 40% to 50%.</p>

<p>d. We can use the line of best fit to find an estimate for the time it would take for the battery to charge from 0 to 100%. If we extend the line to the left, we see that it crosses the horizontal axis at about $-60$. So we can estimate that it would have taken 60 minutes for the battery to go from 0% to 41% and we already estimated that it would take about 75 minutes to go from 41% to 100%. So it would take about 135 minutes to charge the battery all the way from 0 to 100%.</p>

<p><img alt=""Total_length_ac54933bb246d5b4fafa80df787aeaec"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/illustrativemathematics/images/000/002/518/large/total_length_ac54933bb246d5b4fafa80df787aeaec.jpg?1372306839"" /></p>

<p>This is probably not a bad estimate. Our average rate of change calculations show that we are probably underestimating the time it takes to charge the last 20 percentage points. But on the other hand, we probably overestimated the time it takes for the battery to go from 0 to 40%, so we should be close overall.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to see if there is a relationship between the cost per slice of supermarket pizzas and the calories per serving. The margin shows data for a sample of 15 such pizza brands, and a somewhat linear trend. A line fitted via technology might suggest that you should expect to see an increase of about 43 calories if you go from one brand to another that is one dollar more in price. But, the line does not appear to fit the data well and the correlation coefficient r... is only about 0.5. Students will observe that there is one pizza that does not seem to fit the pattern of the others, the one with maximum cost. Why is it way out there? A check reveals that it is Amy&rsquo;s Organic Crust &amp; Tomatoes, the only organic pizza in the sample. If the outlier (Amy&rsquo;s pizza) is removed and the discussion is narrowed to non-organic pizzas (as shown in the plot for pizzas other than Amy&rsquo;s), the relationship between calories and price is much stronger with an expected increase of 124 calories per extra dollar spent and a correlation coefficient of 0.8. Narrowing the question allows for a better interpretation of the slope of a line fitted to the data.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Many counties in the United States are governed by a county council. At public county council meetings, county residents are usually allowed to bring up issues of concern. At a recent public County Council meeting, one resident expressed concern that 3 new coffee shops from a popular coffee shop chain were planning to open in the county, and the resident believed that this would create an increase in property crimes in the county. (Property crimes include burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson -- From&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/property-crime%20accessed%20on%20December%205,%202012"">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/property-crime accessed on December 5, 2012</a>.)</p>

<p>The scatterplot shows a positive linear relationship between &quot;Shops&quot; (the number of coffee shops of this coffee shop chain in the county) and &quot;Crimes&quot; (the number of annual property crimes for the county).

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>a. The relationship does appear to be linear. The relationship would be considered a&nbsp;<em>strong</em>&nbsp;and positive given how closely the points adhere to a line with positive slope.</p>

<p>b.&nbsp;r=0.968. Since the pattern shown is one of very strong, positive, linear association, a correlation coefficient value near +1 is plausible.</p>

<p>c.&nbsp;415.7&sdot;3=1247.1. According to the model, the predicted increase in the number of annual property crimes for a county with 3 additional coffee shops would be 1247.</p>

<p>d.&nbsp;Association (no matter how strong) does not necessarily imply causation. It is unlikely that building a new coffee shop would cause crime rates to increase, for such logic would imply that coffee drinkers engage in more criminal behavior than non-coffee drinkers, the coffee shop attracts criminals to the county, etc. From a perspective of context, students should consider other variables that may be responsible for the association (e.g., counties with higher populations or higher population density may have both more coffee shops and more property crimes). As stated in the &quot;commentary&quot; above, depending upon student knowledge of experiments and observational studies, a discussion can occur reinforcing the risk associated with stating/implying causation based on data from an observational study.According to the model, the predicted increase in the number of annual property crimes for a county with 3 additional coffee shops would be 1247.</p>

<p>e.&nbsp;With the addition of the two observations, the scatterplot now displays a curved relationship with one outlier at (50, 20800). The scatterplot still shows a positive relationship between &quot;Shops&quot; (the number of coffee shops of this coffee shop chain in the county) and &quot;Crimes&quot; (the number of annual property crimes for the county in the previous year) &ndash; but the relationship no longer appears to be linear (or does not appear as linear as before). When only a few observations are used to assess a trend, sometimes just adding one or two points can change the appearance significantly. The new plot is shown below. This relationship might be modeled using a quadratic or an exponential curve.</p>

<p>Researchers have noticed that the number of golf courses and the number of divorcees in the United States are strongly correlated and both have been increasing over the last several decades. Can you conclude that the increasing number of golf courses is causing the number of divorcees to increase?</p>

<p>Either justify why a causation can be inferred, or explain what might account for the correlation other than a causal relation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class=""detail"">
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>No, we cannot conclude that the increasing number of golf courses is causing the number of divorcees to increase. In general, correlation does not imply causation.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors that may be increasing the number of golf courses and a number of factors causing the rise in number of divorcees. These factors may be (and are often) different. For example, there might be a rise in the popularity of the sport of golf that is in part causing the increase in the number of golf courses. However, the number of divorcees might be increasing due in part to the relative ease with which one can obtain a divorce now as opposed to, say, 10 years ago.</p>

<p>There may even be some global factors that are causing both numbers to increase, for example the rise in global population (i.e., there are more people on the planet earth, period). However, this rise in population would not necessarily create a link between the sport of golf and divorcees.</p>

Students must see that one of the most common misinterpretations of correlation is to think of it as a synonym for causation. A high correlation between two variables (suggesting a statistical association between the two) does not imply that one causes the other. It is not a cost increase that causes calories to increase in pizza, and it is not a calorie increase per se that causes cost to increase; the addition of other expensive ingredients cause both to increase simultaneously. Students should look for examples of correlation being interpreted as cause and sort out why that reasoning is incorrect. Examples may include medications versus disease symptoms and teacher pay or class size versus high school graduation rates.</p>
